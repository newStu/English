Hey, Jennie. My flight is delayed.
The pilot says it's because of thunderstorms.

Uh oh. Could you book a different flight?

No, I couldn't book a different flight.

Oh, that's too bad.

Did you eat? Are you hungry?

I'm really hungry. I couldn't eat before.
So, I'll get some food now.

Okay. See you later.

A："哎呀Jennie，我的航班延误啦！机长说是雷暴天气导致的..."
B："天呐！那你能改签其他航班吗？"
A："不行呀...我试过了但没订到其他航班"

## 词汇课: 天气与季节

The **helicopter** saved them from the sea.     

There are many clouds on a **cloudy** day.

A **storm** usually comes with **strong wind** and **heavy rain**.      

**Autumn** is the season between summer and winter.     

In **spring**, plants like flowers and grass grow again.            

My umbrella is **wet**. Could you give me a bag?            

The land in the desert is **dry**.          

We can't see the trees clearly on a **foggy** day.          

We can see **the moon** at night.  

直升机把他们从海上救起来啦！        
阴天的时候天上可多云朵啦~           
今天大风天，风刮得特别猛！      
暴风雨通常都伴随着狂风和暴雨呢。     
秋天是夏天和冬天之间的季节。      
到了春天，花草树木又开始生长喽。          
我的雨伞都湿透了，能给我个袋子吗？      
沙漠里的土地特别干燥。        
雾天的时候连树都看不清呢。            
晚上我们能看到月亮挂在天上哦。

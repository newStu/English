## 综合课: 谁是最佳男演员

```txt
I'm sure Anderson will be the Actor of the Year.

Have you seen any of his movies?

Yes, I've seen all of them.

What role did he play in his last one?

He was a doctor and learned to make difficult choices.
I don't want to give you any spoilers.
But I found the story very compelling.

I see. What about Peterson?
He played a policeman in the movie we saw last month.

You mean "Impossible Job"?

Yeah. The movie has been on top at the box office for four weeks.
And recently I've read about him many times in the news.

We'll find out soon.

The Actor of the Year goes to ... Jackson!

A: 我确信Anderson一定会成为今年的最佳男演员！
B: 你看过他的电影吗？
A: 看过，他的作品我全都看过了。
B: 他最近一部电影演的是什么角色？
A: 他演一个医生，要学会做出艰难抉择。不过我不想剧透太多，但我觉得这个故事非常引人入胜。
B: 这样啊。那Peterson怎么样？上个月我们看的那部电影里他演了个警察。
A: 你说的是《不可能的任务》吗？
B: 对！这部电影已经连续四周蝉联票房冠军了。而且最近我经常在新闻上看到他的消息。
A: 很快就能知道结果了。
今年的最佳男演员是...Jackson！
```

If someone **gives you a spoiler**, they tell you the story of a movie or TV show before you watch it.

Don't read the newspaper now because it has **spoilers** of the show.

If you find a movie **compelling**, you think it's interesting and want to keep watching it.

His latest book has a **compelling** story.

If something is **impossible**, it cannot happen.

It's **impossible** to finish the job in an hour.

If a movie does well at the **box office**, many people have seen it in the cinema.

The movie has taken in 20 million dollars at the **box office**.

如果有人给你剧透（spoiler），就是在你看电影或电视剧前就告诉你剧情。  
现在别看报纸，上面有这部剧的剧透（spoilers）。    
如果你觉得一部电影引人入胜（compelling），说明你觉得它很有趣，想继续看下去。  
他最新的书有一个引人入胜（compelling）的故事。  
如果某件事不可能（impossible），意思是它不可能发生。  
要在一小时内完成这个工作是不可能的（impossible）。  
如果一部电影票房（box office）表现好，说明有很多人去电影院看了它。  
这部电影的票房（box office）收入已达2000万美元。 

## 语法课: Lily 的视频日志

```txt
Hi there, this is Lily.

As you may know, we finished the first part of filming for Green last month.

I enjoyed every minute of my stay in Spain last year.

The food was amazing there.

And it was nice to work with the local team.

They were awesome.

大家好，我是Lily。
正如你们所知道的，我们上个月完成了电影《Green》第一部分的拍摄。
去年在西班牙的每一分钟我都非常享受。
那里的美食简直太棒了。和当地团队合作也很愉快。他们真的超级棒！

## 口语课: 首映式惊喜

```txt
Meg, there you are!
I thought you left without me.

Of course not.
I wouldn't leave you alone.

I didn't expect so many fans to show up at the premiere.
It took me thirty minutes to get out of the theater.
What happened after we got separated in the crowd?

I came across Lily in a hallway and took a selfie with her!
It was the best part of the night.

Oh... wow.. good for you.
You took a selfie with Lily without me?

Well, I could photoshop you in, so it looks like you were there.
How does that sound?

A: Meg！你在这儿啊！我还以为你丢下我自己走了呢！
B: 怎么可能！我怎么会丢下你一个人。
A: 没想到首映式来了这么多粉丝，我在影院里挤了半小时才出来。我们在人群里走散后你都干嘛了？
B: 我在走廊碰到Lily了！还跟她自拍了！简直是我今晚最开心的事！
A: 哦...哇...真为你高兴。你自己跟Lily自拍不带我？
B: 我可以把你P进去啊，这样看起来就像你也在场一样。你觉得怎么样？

At eight, but I normally get up around six a.m.

What do you do for exercise?

I usually run in the park by my house.

All that plus school work. That sounds like a lot!

Well,  I also take part in a Lily fan club.

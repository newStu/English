Our teacher chooses which students get to go!
And she chose me and Mia out of all the students. Come on, Mom!

Well, it is a good opportunity. You should go.
I am so excited that i'm going to say yes!
Let's see what your dad thinks, too.

Thanks, Mom. I'm so happy. You are the best!

     我如此自豪你和米娅是如此优秀的学生。
Ellen: 谢谢你，妈妈！
       哦，我们的老师建议我们今年夏天参加海外学习项目！
Mom: 真的吗？她说什么了？
Ellen: 嗯，她和其他一位老师将在夏天带十二名学生去法国三个星期。
       我们将能够练习法语并游览整个法国！
Mom: 那听起来确实令人兴奋。
     但是你确定你准备好没有我和爸爸陪同就出国了吗？
Ellen: 我觉得我准备好了，而且这是一个不容错过的好机会。
       我们的老师来选择哪些学生可以去！
       她从所有学生中选择了我和米娅。拜托妈妈！
Mom: 好吧，这确实是个好机会。你应该去。
     我太兴奋了，我要说同意！

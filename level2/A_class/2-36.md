My job is usually pretty pleasant, but sometimes it's a challenge.

Once, there was a guest who ordered 20 steaks to room service.

Our kitchen staff, who are excellent, were able to complete the order.

But here's the reason I like my job: it's full of surprises.

One guest cut up all the towels he used with scissors.

The cleaning lady who found them was quite surprised.

My boss (who I love) had to tell the guest to stop.

Yes, this is the most interesting job I've ever had!

我的工作通常很愉快，但有时也充满挑战。
曾经有位客人点了20份牛排的客房服务。
我们的厨房团队非常出色，顺利完成了这个订单。
不过我喜欢这份工作的原因是它充满惊喜：
有位客人用剪刀把他用过的毛巾都剪碎了。
发现这个情况的清洁阿姨非常惊讶。
我那位(我很喜欢的)老板不得不去制止这位客人。
是的，这是我做过最有趣的工作！

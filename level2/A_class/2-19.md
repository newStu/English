Farmers sell their food to people at farmers' markets.
Farmers have tables to sell fruits, vegetables, meat, flowers and other things.
People usually pay cash at a farmers' market.
People love to buy things at farmers' markets for many reasons.

First, farmers' markets are cheaper than supermarkets.
For example, a kilogram of green beans is only $2 at the farmers' market.
A big pack of sausage is only $8 and all of the money goes to the farmers.

Second, the fruits and vegetables are local and fresh.
You can smell, touch and pick the freshest fruits and veggies.

Third, many farmers' markets are outside.
People can enjoy shopping outside with their families.
It's also a nice place to meet and chat with farmers.


你通常在哪里购买食物？
有些人去超市采购,还有人喜欢去农夫集市购买新鲜食材。
农民们在集市上直接售卖自家产品，他们摆摊出售水果、蔬菜、肉类、花卉等农产品。
集市交易通常使用现金支付，人们偏爱农夫集市有多重原因。
首先价格比超市更实惠，例如青豆每公斤仅需2美元，大包香肠8美元且钱款直接惠及农户。
其次果蔬都是本地新鲜直供，顾客可以闻嗅、触摸并挑选最新鲜的农产品。
再者许多集市设在露天场所，全家能享受户外购物乐趣，也是与农民交流的好去处。

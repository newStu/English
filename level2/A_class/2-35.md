Hey, Al, do you have a minute? Can we talk?

Yea, sure. I was just about to play some video games.
Do you want to play?

Well, maybe later. I need to talk to you first.

All right. What's up?

I have some good news and bad news.
What do you want to hear first?

Oh? How about the bad news first?

Ok... I can't rent this apartment with you anymore.

Why? Is something wrong?

No... Here comes the good news.
I'm moving to China!

China? Really?

Yes! I got a great job there and I'm really excited about it.

Wow, well... Congratulations, Mike!

I'm really happy for you and I understand.
I hope you have a great time in China.
Don't forget to come back often and visit your old friends!

Of course. Thanks for understanding, Al.

Mike: 嘿，Al，有空吗？能聊聊吗？
Al: 有啊，当然。我正准备打会儿游戏呢。要一起玩吗？
Mike: 呃，可能待会儿吧。先跟你说个事儿。
Al: 好啊，什么事？
Mike: 我有好消息也有坏消息。你想先听哪个？
Al: 哦？先听坏消息吧。
Mike: 好吧...我不能再跟你合租这套公寓了。
Al: 为什么？出什么问题了吗？
Mike: 不是...现在该说好消息了。我要搬去中国了！
Al: 中国？真的吗？
Mike: 对！我在那边找到份很棒的工作，特别期待。
Al: 哇，好吧...恭喜你Mike！真心为你高兴，我理解的。
    希望你在中国过得开心。别忘了常回来看看老朋友！
Mike: 当然不会忘。谢谢你理解，Al。

Hey Mike, did you know that Al is having a party tomorrow night?
He said that lots of people will be there.

Wait, what? He told me that he's busy.
I think he's mad at me for leaving.

Oh shoot, what did I do? Al is going to kill me.

Why? Just because you told me he's having a party?

No. I just remembered it's a surprise party for you.
He said we should keep it a secret.
I feel terrible! I hope you don't hate me for this.

Don't worry. I know that it was an accident.
Now I can surprise him!

A: 嘿Mike，你知道Al明晚要办派对吗？他说会有很多人来参加。
Mike: 等等，什么？他告诉我说他很忙啊。我觉得他是因为我要离开而生我的气了。
A: 糟糕，我做了什么？Al会杀了我的。
Mike: 为什么？就因为你告诉我他要办派对吗？
A: 不是。我刚想起来这是为你准备的惊喜派对。他说我们应该保密的。
   我太糟糕了！希望你不要因此讨厌我。
Mike: 别担心。我知道这是个意外。现在我可以反过来给他个惊喜了！

## 听力课: 搬到中国

```txt
Hi, I'm Daniel. I'm from Australia.
I am moving to China next month.
I'm going to work as an English teacher and I want to live in Chengdu.
Why Chengdu?
First, the food! I hope I can try hotpot and Sichuan food.
Second, the pandas! I hope I can see the pandas in Chengdu, too!
Now I have been in Chengdu for one month.
I really enjoy living in China, but I can't speak Chinese well!
Sometimes, people don't understand me.
For example, the taxi driver can't understand where I want to go.
So, I'm going to start learning Chinese next week.
I hope I can speak Chinese well soon.

大家好，我是Daniel，来自澳大利亚。我下个月就要搬到中国去了。
我将在那里担任英语老师，而且我打算住在成都。为什么选择成都呢？
首先是因为美食！我希望能品尝到火锅和川菜。其次是因为大熊猫！
我也很期待能在成都看到大熊猫！现在我已经在成都住了一个月。
我真的很喜欢在中国的生活，但我的中文还不太好。有时候人们听不懂我说的话。
比如出租车司机就听不懂我要去哪里。所以我决定下周开始学习中文。
希望很快就能说一口流利的中文！
```

## 口语课: 办理签证

```txt
Did you get your visa yet?

No, not yet. I'm going to the embassy tomorrow. I hope I get it!

If you don't get your visa, will you still be able to move abroad?

No, I can't go to China without a visa.
I already paid one month's rent for an apartment in Shanghai.
Without a visa, I'll lose my apartment too!

Oh wow, I hope that doesn't happen.

Me too!

A: 你拿到签证了吗？
B: 还没有。我明天要去大使馆办理，希望能顺利拿到！
A: 如果没拿到签证，你还能出国吗？
B: 不行，没有签证就去不了中国。我已经付了上海公寓一个月的房租了。
   如果拿不到签证，连房子也得放弃了！
A: 哇，希望不会发生这种情况。
B: 我也希望如此！

Hey Mike, what's up? I heard the news you're moving to China.

That's exciting. I hope you have a good time. 
Is Al looking for a new roommate?

Good idea. I can ask Al to call him later. What's his phone number?

Thanks!

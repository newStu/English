## 综合课: 工作建议

```txt
Annie, you're doing great at work.
Could you give me some advice?

Sure. First, work hard, try not to make mistakes, and don't be late.

Yes, I agree with you, Annie.

Also, a good team is important.
A good team can work quickly but also carefully.

I see.

And it's so important to work well with your team.

Good advice, Annie. Thank you.

::: tip 语法

一些形容词变为副词无规律，例如 good 变副词时是 well

- And it's so important to work **well** with your team.

形容词 + ly 变为副词

- A good team can work **quickly** but also **carefully**.

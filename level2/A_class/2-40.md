## 综合课: 沙滩还是国家公园?

```txt
Allen, my dear! I bought you a new swim suit!
I can't wait to see you in those lovely shorts!

Hi Leo. Can we drop the idea of going to the beach this weekend?

What's going on?

Well. I  get seasick easily. Just thinking of the ocean makes me feel sick.

Whoa! I  didn't know that.

So... How about going to the national park?
It's really nice there.

Sounds good! Hey, we could have a picnic!

Yeah! That's a great idea.

By the way, should I  bring my grill so that we can have a barbecue?

Better not. Barbecues aren't allowed in the park.

Alright. I'm pumped for the trip!

Linda, Leo said the ocean makes him feel sick.
We have to go to the national park instead.

C: 亲爱的Allen！我给你买了新泳衣！好期待看你穿上那条可爱的短裤！
B: 嗨Leo。我们这周末能不去海滩了吗？
A: 怎么了？
B: 嗯...我很容易晕船，光是想到大海就让我觉得不舒服。
A: 哇！我都不知道你有这个问题。
B: 所以...改去国家公园怎么样？那里风景很棒。
A: 听起来不错！嘿，我们可以野餐！
B: 好啊！这个主意太棒了。
A: 顺便问下，我要带烧烤架去烤肉吗？
B: 最好不要。公园里禁止烧烤。
A: 好吧。我已经等不及要去玩了！
C: Linda，Leo说他看到大海就会不舒服。我们得改去国家公园了。

## 听力课: 吃什么好呢?

```txt
I'm hungry. Do you want to go out for dinner?

Yeah, let's go out for pasta.

You can't be serious. We always have pasta.

That's not true. We don't eat it that much.

Uh, we've had pasta for dinner five times this month.

Oh yeah, you're right. I guess we do eat it a lot. How about hamburgers?

To be honest, I  don't want to eat hamburgers either.

OK... Oh, Sichuan beef noodles are good.

Um, I  don't think so. Sichuan food is too spicy. 

I give up. 
Let's just stay at home and order from different restaurants.
Then I can get pasta, and you can pick what you want.

Great idea!

A: 我饿了，要出去吃晚饭吗？
B: 好啊，我们去吃意大利面吧！
A: 你不是认真的吧？我们老吃意大利面。
B: 哪有啊，我们也没经常吃啊。
A: 呃...这个月我们已经吃了五次意大利面了。
B: 哦好像也是。那我们确实吃得太频繁了。要不吃汉堡？
A: 说实话，我也不想吃汉堡...
B: 好吧...四川牛肉面怎么样？
A: 嗯...还是算了吧，川菜太辣了。
B: 我投降了！干脆在家点外卖吧，从不同餐厅点。我吃我的意大利面，你点你想吃的。
A: 好主意！
```

## 听力课: 去海边

```txt
What do you want to do tomorrow?

I don't know. What's on your mind?

How about we build a sandcastle on the beach?

I'm not so sure about that.
We aren't children anymore, are we?

Well, why don't we play beach volleyball?
Beaches are great places to get exercise.

I don't see it that way.
I don't feel like getting too tired.

Or we can stroll along the beach, it'll be fun.

I take your point, but i'd rather lie down and bask in the sun.

Fair enough. That sounds good too. Let's just waste time and grow old together.

A: 明天你想做什么？
B: 不知道啊，你有什么想法？
A: 要不我们去海边堆沙堡吧？
B: 不太确定诶...我们又不是小孩子了，对吧？
A: 那打沙滩排球怎么样？海滩很适合运动。
B: 我不这么觉得，我不想太累。
A: 或者我们沿着海滩散步？会很有趣的。
B: 我明白你的意思啦，但我更想躺着晒太阳。
A: 好吧，那样也不错。我们就一起虚度时光，慢慢变老吧。
```

The kids are building a sandcastle.

The old lady strolled round the park after dinner.

The dog loves to bask in the warm sun.

## 口语课: 假期安排

```txt
Do you have any ideas for our winter holiday this year?

Nope. I'm leaving the planning in your hands.

Let's see.. Do you want to go skiing in the mountains?

And possibly freeze my limbs off? I'll pass.

Or.. How about we visit Thailand? We can lie on the beach and enjoy the sunshine.

No, that place's always so crowded during the winter.

No skiing, no beaches. What do you want to do then?

What about we stay at home and redecorate our house?

That sounds boring.

Come on, I  ordered so many Christmas decorations. I promise it'll be fun. 
I'll tell you what.. I'll do all the cooking. How does that sound?

OK! Now you're talking.

A: 今年寒假你有什么想法吗？  
B: 没有，我把做计划的权利交到你手上。  
A: 让我想想... 想去山上滑雪吗？  
B: 冻掉胳膊腿吗？还是算了。  
A: 那... 去泰国怎么样？可以躺在沙滩上享受阳光。  
B: 不要，冬天那里总是人挤人。  
A: 滑雪不行，海滩也不行。那你想做什么？  
B: 不如我们待在家里重新装修房子？  
A: 听起来好无聊。  
B: 别这样，我买了好多圣诞装饰品。我保证会很有趣！这样吧... 我来负责做饭，怎么样？  
A: 好啊！这才对嘛！  
```

## 口语课: 你做得真棒!

Hey, did you enjoy the team-building trip?

Of course. Thank you for planning it.

You're welcome. I'm happy you enjoyed it.

Well I'd say on a scale of 1 to 10, it was an 11!
You did a good job making the trip a success.

How kind of you to say so!
What was your favorite part?

Well, the sunshine was relaxing, and the food was delicious.
But for me the best part was the team-building activities.

I'm glad you liked them.

I can tell how hard you worked on them.
I'm supposed to organize the next trip.
You've inspired me to already start planning it!

A: 嘿，你喜欢这次团建活动吗？
B: 当然喜欢！谢谢你策划这次活动。
A: 不客气，很高兴你喜欢。
B: 要我说，满分10分的话可以打11分！你把这次活动办得很成功。
A: 你这么说真贴心！最喜欢哪个环节？
B: 阳光很惬意，食物也很美味。但对我来说最棒的是团建活动本身。
A: 真开心你喜欢这些活动。
B: 看得出你为此付出了很多努力。下次该我组织活动了，你已经激励我开始筹备了！

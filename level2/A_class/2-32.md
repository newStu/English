Hi, Peter. How are you?

Hi, Mike. I'm great! How about you?
Aren't you going to be done with school soon?

I don't have a job yet.

Well, what are you interested in doing?

Hmmm, I'm interested in languages.
I also really want to work in a foreign country.
I enjoy meeting people from various places, as you know.

Right. Hey! How about if you come to work in Shanghai?
It would be perfect for you because you could learn Chinese.

Yea, but what would I do there for work?

You know I have a friend, Liz.
She is looking for English speakers to write for her magazine.
Are you interested?

Yes! I am totally interested.

Cool. So, let me talk to Liz next.

Thanks, Peter. Email me or call me soon.

I will. Take care. Bye.

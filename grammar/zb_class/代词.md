原文：找出错误 <br/>
My computer isn't working. <br/>
Anything is wrong. <br/>
Is there something I can help you with? <br/>
Oh, thanks, but I don't think there is nothing we can do. <br/>
Let me ask the IT guy. <br/>

更正：<br/>
Anything is wrong. -> Something is wrong. 肯定句中用 something <br/>
but I don't think there is nothing we can do. -> 应改为 ...anything we can do. 表双重否定

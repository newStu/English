## 综合课: 童年回忆

```txt
Mom, what was your childhood like?

When I was young, my parents were very strict with me.
They expected me to get an A in every subject.

That sounds terrible. Why were they like that?

They said I needed good grades to become a doctor.

Why a doctor?

Because they wanted me to be like them.
You may not know this, but Grandpa was a dentist and Grandma was a doctor.

But you went against their wishes.

Yes. I didn't think being a doctor was the right path for me.
My passion was writing.

Were they upset?

At first, yes.
They didn't believe I could get a well-paid job in writing.

What happened next?

After high school, I started writing for a national newspaper
and making some money.
My parents finally understood that I could make a living by following my dream.
Later, they helped me study journalism in the U.S.
I don't think I would be an editor today without their support.

Mom, when I grow up, I want to be an editor like you!

If that's your dream, I will always support you.

Child: 妈妈，你小时候是什么样的？
Mon: 我小时候，父母对我要求很严格。他们希望我在每门功课上都得A。
Child: 听起来好可怕啊。他们为什么那样？
Mon: 他们说，我需要好成绩才能成为一名医生。
Child: 为什么一定要当医生？
Mon: 因为他们希望我像他们一样。你可能不知道，爷爷是牙医，奶奶是医生。
Child: 但你违背了他们的愿望。
Mon: 是的。我觉得当医生不适合我，我的热情在于写作。
Child: 他们生气了吗？
Mon: 一开始是的。他们不相信写作能找到一份高薪的工作。
Child: 后来呢？
Mon: 高中毕业后，我开始为一家全国性报纸写稿，也开始赚钱了。
     父母终于明白，我可以靠追求梦想谋生。后来，他们还支持我去美国学习新闻学。
     如果没有他们的支持，我不可能成为今天的编辑。
Child: 妈妈，我长大后也想成为像你一样的编辑！
Mon: 如果那是你的梦想，我会永远支持你。
```

Honey, do you want to go on a family trip this weekend?

A family trip? I don't think that's a good idea.

Why not? The kids would be super happy.

I don't believe you remember what happened on our last trip to Hawaii.
We only spent four days there but we got so tired.

Things will be different this time. I promise.
We can do just a two-day trip and go camping somewhere.
I don't believe it will be as tiring as the Hawaii trip.  (as...as 和……一样)

Okay, fine. Let's talk to the kids and ask their opinions.

Great! I don't think they will say no to my plan.

A: 亲爱的，这个周末你想去来一次家庭旅行吗？
B: 家庭旅行？我不觉得这是个好主意。
A: 为什么？孩子们会非常开心的。
B: 我不相信你不记得上次我们去夏威夷旅行发生了什么。我们在那儿只待了四天，但累得够呛。
A: 这次情况会不一样，我保证。我们可以只进行两天的短途旅行，找个地方露营。
   我不觉得这次会像夏威夷之行那么累。（as...as 表示“和……一样”）
B: 好吧，好吧。那我们去和孩子们谈谈，问问他们的意见。
A: 太好了！我不认为他们会拒绝我的计划。

## 听力课: 少即是多

```txt
When I was young, my parents were really strict.
They wanted me to do well in life, so I was always studying.
And I was successful. I went to a great college, and found an amazing job.
But though I was making a good living, I felt empty.

Looking back on my childhood, I realized I only did what my parents told me.
I wanted to know who I was. So I quit my job and traveled for a year.
My parents were really mad.

I have a daughter now.
I encourage her to study, and to stick to things she likes to do.
But I also don't push her too hard. My friends don't think this is a good idea.
But I think it's important to let her find her own dreams.

我小时候，父母对我非常严格。
他们希望我在生活中取得好成绩，所以我一直在学习。
我也确实很成功：上了很好的大学，找到了一份很棒的工作。
但尽管生活富裕，我内心却感到空虚。

回顾童年，我意识到自己一直只是在做父母让我做的事。
我想知道真正的我是谁。于是我辞掉了工作，旅行了一整年。
父母对此非常生气。

现在我有了一个女儿。
我鼓励她学习，也鼓励她坚持自己喜欢的事情。
但我不会给她太大压力。朋友们觉得这样做不太好。
但我认为，让她找到自己的梦想很重要。

## 口语课: 未来计划

```txt
Jake, what are your plans after graduation?

I know you expect me to take over your company.
That's why you've always been strict with me since I was a child.

So, what do you think about it?

Well, I don't want to go against your wishes,
but I've given some thought to creating something on my own, like an app.

It'll be hard to make a living by starting your own business,
don't you think?

I agree, but I'd be happier if I succeeded without my family's support,
don't you agree?

I see your point.
Anyway, I'm sorry I wasn't the happiest father to be around in your childhood.

Dad, thanks for your understanding.
When I look back, I really appreciate everything you did for me.

Dad ：Jake，你毕业后的计划是什么？
Jake ： 我知道你期望我接管你的公司。这就是为什么你从小就对我一直很严格。
Dad ： 那么，你对此有什么想法吗？
Jake ： 嗯，我不想违背你的意愿，但我确实考虑过自己去创造一些东西，比如开发一个应用程序。
Dad ： 靠自己创业谋生会很难吧，你不觉得吗？
Jake ： 我同意，但如果能在没有家人支持的情况下取得成功，我会更快乐，你不赞同吗？
Dad ： 我明白你的意思了。不管怎样，抱歉在你小时候我没有成为一个让你感到快乐的父亲。
Jake ： 爸爸，谢谢你的理解。当我回顾过去时，我真的很感激你为我所做的一切。

I have great news, Steve!
What is it, Christina?
I have decided to get a pet!
Wow, that's a big decision.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure!
I have always wanted a pet.
Who'll take care of your pet when you go on vacation?
Well... I wanted to ask you for your advice.
You have cats and dogs.
What do you do with them when you go on vacation?
I take them to my parents' house.
Ok, maybe my sister can help watch my pet.What kind of pet are you going to get?
I really want a bulldog,
I love the way bulldogs look and I can't wait to cuddle him.
Him?
Yes! I'm going to get a male puppy and call him Buddy.
I'm happy for you, but remember that you also need to train Buddy.
I can help you with the training.
Thanks, Steve.
Oh, I'll also give you my vet's contact information.
He is the best vet!
Awesome!I'll make a great pet parent one day.
Of course you will!

是什么事，Christina？
我决定养宠物了！
哇，这是一个很大的决定。
你确定吗？
是的，我很确定！
我一直想养一只宠物。
你去度假的时候谁来照顾你的宠物呢？
嗯……我想向你请教一下建议。
你养过猫和狗。
你去度假时是怎么安排它们的？
我会把它们带到我父母家。
好的，也许我姐姐可以帮助照看我的宠物。你打算养什么宠物？
我真的很想养一只斗牛犬，
我喜欢斗牛犬的样子，迫不及待想要抱抱它。
它是公的？
是的！我要养一只雄性的小狗，并叫它Buddy。
我为你感到高兴，但别忘了还要训练Buddy。
我可以帮你一起训练。
谢谢，Steve。
哦，我还会把我的兽医联系方式给你。
他可是最好的兽医！
太棒了！总有一天我会成为一个优秀的宠物主人。
当然你会的！

## 语法课：a/an/the 的用法

```txt
Are you a pet owner?
If you have a pet, there is something that you should know.

The food that you like is not always the best food for your pet.
For example, kittens can't drink cow's milk.
Another kind of milk is a better choice - goat's milk!

Chocolate is another dangerous food.
Do not feed chocolate to dogs.
It can cause them health problems.

It's an excellent idea to check on the internet before you give human food to pets.
It might not be safe.


你是宠物主人吗？
如果你有宠物，有一些事情你应该知道。
你喜欢的食物并不总是最适合宠物的食物。
例如，小猫不能喝牛奶。
另一种牛奶是更好的选择——山羊奶！
巧克力是另一种危险的食物。
不要给狗喂巧克力。
这可能会导致它们出现健康问题。
在给宠物喂食人类食物之前，上网查一查是个好主意。
它可能并不安全。

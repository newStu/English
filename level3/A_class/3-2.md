Wow, what a delightful restaurant!

Thanks for taking me out for my birthday.

No problem. How was your day?

Today was really tiring, actually.

What did you do?

Well, after taking part in meetings all morning, I met with two clients,
and then wrote several reports.

Sounds like you had a busy birthday.

Yeah, I did. Actually, work has been crazy for several months now.
What about you? How has your work been?

Really good. I just finished my latest movie.

Well done!

Thanks! Now let's pick some wine to share before ordering our dinner.

This is great. A fun night out is just what I needed.

Uh-oh.I think some fans saw that I'm here.
They are looking at us through the window.

Oh no, are they going to cause a problem?

Well, it's only a few people, so everything should be fine.
I'll just quickly go outside and take some pictures with them.

Um, Lily. I think it's more than a few. It looks like there
are a lot of people outside.

Oh no! I'm sorry, Margo, but I think more and more fans will keep showing up.
We probably should go...


哇，这真是一家令人愉快的餐厅！
谢谢你生日这天带我出来。
不客气。你今天过得怎么样？
其实今天非常累。
你都做了些什么？
整个上午都在开会，之后见了两位客户，然后写了好几份报告。
听起来你的生日过得很忙碌啊。
是啊。事实上，这几个月工作一直都很忙。
那你呢？你最近的工作怎么样？
非常好。我刚刚完成了我最新的电影。
太棒了！
谢谢！现在我们来选一瓶酒，等下配晚餐一起喝。
这真是太好了。一场轻松愉快的夜晚正是我所需要的。
啊哦，我想有些粉丝发现我在这里了。
他们正透过窗户看着我们。
啊？他们会惹出什么麻烦吗？
嗯，只是几个人的话，应该没问题。
我去外面快速和他们拍几张照片就好。
呃，Lily，我觉得不止几个人。看起来外面已经聚集很多人了。
糟糕！对不起，Margo，我觉得会有越来越多的粉丝过来。
我们可能得先走了……

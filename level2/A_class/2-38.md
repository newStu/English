```txt
Excuse me, I want to go to People's Park.
Which subway line should I take?

You can take Line 1, Line 2, or Line 8.

Ok and which stop should I get off at?

You'll get off at the People's Square station.
People's Park is not too far from that station.
You will hear the stops in both Chinese and English.

Good and how do I buy a ticket?

You can go to that ticket machine over there.
For the machine, you need coins.

Ok. Could you please help me buy the ticket?
I can't read in Chinese yet.
It's too difficult for me.

Oh, don't worry. The instructions are in both Chinese and English.

Great, thank you!

A square is an open place in a city or town. People's Square is a famous city square in China.

There are over fifteen subway lines in Shanghai. I take Line 2 every day.

You can buy subway tickets from a ticket machine.

You need coins to buy tickets from the machine.

Subway Line 2 is too crowded. I prefer to take a bus.

My office is too far from the subway station.

Instructions tell us how to do or use something.

The instructions are too long. I don't want to read them.

I really like this apartment, but it's too expensive!

That apartment is too small for me.

Learning Chinese is too difficult for me.

广场是城市或城镇中的开放场所。人民广场是中国著名的城市广场。  
上海有超过十五条地铁线路。我每天乘坐 2 号线。  
您可以从售票机购买地铁票。  
您需要硬币才能在售票机上买票。  
地铁 2 号线太拥挤了。我更喜欢乘坐公共汽车。
我的办公室离地铁站太远。  
说明告诉我们如何做某事或使用某物。  
说明太长了。我不想读。  
我确实喜欢这套公寓，但是太贵了!
那套公寓对我来说太小了。  
学习中文对我来说太困难了。

## 听力课: 伦敦地铁

```txt
Do you know which city has the oldest subway?

It's London! London's subway opened in 1863.

The first trains were made of wood and they were slow.

But, by the 1900s, the subway started to use electricity.

People used to only buy their subway tickets from machines.

Those ticket machines were too crowded.

So in 2003, London started to use a new metro card.

The metro card is now called the Oyster card.

Today, in London, the buses are too slow and the taxis are too expensive.

Taking the subway is a more popular way to travel in London.

The London subway is called "the Tube".

There are 11 lines and more than 270 stops.

The London subway is now the third largest in the world.

So what do you think of the "the Tube"?

Do you want to take a ride on the oldest subway in the world?

你知道哪个城市拥有最古老的地铁系统吗？
是伦敦！伦敦地铁于1863年开通。
最初的列车是用木头制造的，速度很慢。
但是到了20世纪初，地铁开始使用电力。
人们过去只能从售票机购买地铁票。
那些售票机实在太拥挤了。
因此在2003年，伦敦开始使用一种新的地铁卡。
这种地铁卡现在被称为"牡蛎卡"。
如今在伦敦，公交车太慢，出租车又太贵。
乘坐地铁成为伦敦更受欢迎的出行方式。
伦敦地铁被称为"the Tube"。
共有11条线路和超过270个车站。
伦敦地铁现在是世界第三大地铁系统。
那么你觉得这个"地铁"怎么样？
你想乘坐世界上最古老的地铁体验一下吗？

## 口语课: 乘坐地铁

```txt
Are you sure Line 1 is the fastest way to People's Square?

Of course. If we transfer at West Nanjing Road we'll have to leave
the station again. It will take too much time.

Still, my maps app says it's the quickest route.

I have lived here for three years. I think I know the metro better than an app.

All right, I'll follow your instructions.
These subway lines are too difficult for me to understand.

Good, here comes the train. Let's get on it.

Okay, okay, no need to hurry.

A: 你确定1号线是去人民广场最快的方式吗？
B: 当然。如果我们在南京西路换乘，还得重新出站，太浪费时间了。
A: 可是我的地图app显示这是最快的路线啊。
B: 我在这住了三年了，我觉得我比app更了解地铁。
A: 好吧，我听你的。这些地铁线路对我来说太难理解了。
B: 太好了，车来了。我们上车吧。
A: 好的好的，不用着急。
```

## 口语课: 寻找地铁入口

```txt
Do you remember where the subway entrance is?

Not really. This place is too crowded for me to find it.

When we came out of the exit, we were next to the square.
We shouldn't be too far from the entrance.

Oh, I  think I  see it over there.

Great! Oh wait a minute, I don't have enough coins for the fare!

That's okay. I can give you some of mine.

Thanks. Now we just have to remember what subway line to get on.

No problem, I have a maps app for that.

A: 你还记得地铁入口在哪儿吗？
B: 不太记得了。这里人太多了，我找不到。
A: 我们刚才从出口出来时是在广场旁边。入口应该不会太远。
B: 噢，我想我看到了，就在那边。
A: 太好了！等等...我身上带的硬币不够买票了。
B: 没关系，我可以给你一些。
A: 谢谢。现在只要记得该坐哪条线就行了。
B: 没问题，我有地图app可以查。

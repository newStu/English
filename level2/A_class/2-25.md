## 听力课: 美国高中的一天

```txt
Hi, I'm Jack. I'm studying in a high school in America.

My day usually starts around 7 a.m.

While students in England and China usually have to wear uniforms,
most American students, like me, just wear jeans and T-shirts every day.

I have to take a big yellow school bus to and from school every day.

Some of my friends drive in their own cars to and from school.

In the US, teenagers can drive at 16 years old.

My first class begins around 7:30 a.m.

In all,  have to study eight subjects:
English, Math, Biology, Physics,Geography, History, Chemistry, and Writing.

Each class is 90 minutes, and there is a 10-minute break in between classes.

During breaks, I have to walk quickly to my next class.

School usually ends around 3 p.m.

Many students have an after-school activity, such as sports or music.

I love playing the guitar and I play in a band after school.

大家好，我是Jack，目前在美国一所高中就读。我的一天通常从早上7点左右开始。
虽然英国和中国的学生通常需要穿校服，但大多数美国学生（包括我）每天只需穿牛仔裤和T恤。
我每天都要乘坐黄色校车往返学校。我的一些朋友会开私家车上下学。
在美国，青少年年满16岁就可以开车。第一节课程大约在早上7:30开始。
总共需要学习八门科目：英语、数学、生物、物理、地理、历史、化学和写作课。
每节课90分钟，课间有10分钟休息时间。休息时我得快步赶往下一节课。
学校通常在下午3点左右放学。很多学生都会参加课后活动，比如运动或音乐。
我特别喜欢弹吉他，放学后还会参加乐队排练。

most American students, like me, just wear jeans and T-shirts every day.

Some of my friends drive in their own cars to and from school.

In the US, teenagers can drive at 16 years old.

My first class begins around 7:30 a.m.

In all,  have to study eight subjects:
English, Math, Biology, Physics,Geography, History, Chemistry, and Writing.

Each class is 90 minutes, and there is a 10-minute break in between classes.

During breaks, I have to walk quickly to my next class.

School usually ends around 3 p.m.

Many students have an after-school activity, such as sports or music.

I love playing the guitar and I play in a band after school.

在美国，青少年年满16岁就可以开车。第一节课程大约在早上7:30开始。

每节课90分钟，课间有10分钟休息时间。休息时我得快步赶往下一节课。
学校通常在下午3点左右放学。很多学生都会参加课后活动，比如运动或音乐。

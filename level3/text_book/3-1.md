I have great news, Steve!
What is it, Christina?
I have decided to get a pet!
Wow, that's a big decision.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure!
I have always wanted a pet.
Who'll take care of your pet when you go on vacation?
Well... I wanted to ask you for your advice.
You have cats and dogs.
What do you do with them when you go on vacation?
I take them to my parents' house.
Ok, maybe my sister can help watch my pet.What kind of pet are you going to get?
I really want a bulldog,
I love the way bulldogs look and I can't wait to cuddle him.
Him?
Yes! I'm going to get a male puppy and call him Buddy.
I'm happy for you, but remember that you also need to train Buddy.
I can help you with the training.
Thanks, Steve.
Oh, I'll also give you my vet's contact information.
He is the best vet!
Awesome!I'll make a great pet parent one day.
Of course you will!

我有好消息要告诉你，Steve！
是什么事，Christina？
我决定养宠物了！
哇，这是一个很大的决定。
你确定吗？
是的，我很确定！
我一直想养一只宠物。
你去度假的时候谁来照顾你的宠物呢？
嗯……我想向你请教一下建议。
你养过猫和狗。
你去度假时是怎么安排它们的？
我会把它们带到我父母家。
好的，也许我姐姐可以帮助照看我的宠物。你打算养什么宠物？
我真的很想养一只斗牛犬，
我喜欢斗牛犬的样子，迫不及待想要抱抱它。
它是公的？
是的！我要养一只雄性的小狗，并叫它Buddy。
我为你感到高兴，但别忘了还要训练Buddy。
我可以帮你一起训练。
谢谢，Steve。
哦，我还会把我的兽医联系方式给你。
他可是最好的兽医！
太棒了！总有一天我会成为一个优秀的宠物主人。
当然你会的！

Hello, are you Mike?

Yes, I called about the apartment yesterday.

Please come in.I can show you around.
I'm the apartment manager, Liu.

Thanks, Liu.

You can see that it has one bedroom, one bathroom, a kitchen,
and a big living room.

Wow, this place is amazing.
I like it.

It comes with all of the furniture that you see here.

I love the furniture!
What a nice sofa!
How much is the rent?

It's a very good price.
It costs 3300 RMB per month.

The price is good, but it took me a long time to get here.
My job is in the city center.

Well, this is very far outside of the city center.
That's why the price is so good.

I really like the place.
What a pity that it's so far from work!

B: 你好，是Mike吗？
A: 是的，我昨天打电话咨询过这套公寓。
B: 请进，我带您看看。我是公寓管理员刘。
A: 谢谢，刘。

A: 哇，这地方太棒了。我很喜欢。
B: 这里包含您看到的所有家具。
A: 这些家具太棒了！多好的沙发啊！租金是多少？
B: 价格很优惠。每月3300元。
A: 价格是不错，但我过来花了很长时间。我的工作地点在市中心。
B: 嗯，这里离市中心确实很远。所以价格才这么优惠。

I love your furniture! Where did you get it?

Well, the sofa was bought by my landlord. He left it here.
This is my bookshelf, though.
It is made of fine African wood.

Was it expensive?

No, but the carpet was expensive. It is made of wool.

I see. I'm thinking of getting something nice for my home.
The place I rent was built in 1990. It looks really old.

You can buy carpets or curtains to make it look modern!

A: 你的家具真棒！是在哪儿买的？
B: 沙发是房东买的，他留在这里了。不过这个书柜是我自己的，是用上好的非洲木材做的。
A: 贵不贵？
B: 不贵，但地毯很贵，是羊毛材质的。
A: 这样啊。我也想给家里添置些好东西。
   我租的房子是1990年建的，看起来特别旧。
B: 你可以买些地毯或窗帘，让房子看起来现代些！

Well, I really love it. What a pity that it's so expensive!

Sorry. It's too expensive.

No worries. This one is nice, but not so expensive. Do you like this one?

## 口语课: 搬进新公寓

```txt
I'm moving to a new apartment soon.

Why? What's wrong with your old apartment?

The rent became too high. I need to look for a place that is less expensive.

What a pity! I really liked your old apartment. 
It was so close to the city center, 
with so many nice restaurants and bars around.

I know. It really is a pity to move away. 
And it's also very hard to find anew place with a good price.

Why don't you ask Sam for help? 
He just moved to a new apartment,so he might have seen a lot of other places.

What a great idea! I'll call him this afternoon.

A: 我很快要搬新公寓了。
B: 为什么？原来的公寓有什么问题吗？
A: 租金涨得太高了。我需要找个便宜点的地方。
B: 真可惜！我特别喜欢你的旧公寓。那里离市中心很近，周围有很多不错的餐厅和酒吧。
A: 是啊，搬走确实很遗憾。而且现在很难找到价格合适的新住处。
B: 为什么不找Sam帮忙呢？他刚搬了新公寓，可能看过不少地方。
A: 这主意太棒了！我今天下午就给他打电话。

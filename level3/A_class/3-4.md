## 综合课: 如果……

```txt
Oh hi, Lily. What are you doing here?

I wanted to say that I'm sorry for ruining your birthday.I feel awful.

Don't say that.You didn't ruin my birthday.

We were having a nice time until my fans showed up.

Don't worry about it. I'm not upset with you.

Well, I still feel guilty.
My acting career has gotten in the way of our friendship.

It's really OK.

I'm sorry for not being there for you more often!

Well, we both have very busy jobs.
I've missed a lot of important moments in your life, too.

That's true. At dinner last night, you said that you feel tired.

I do. I've been so busy that I don't have any free time anymore.

It sounds like we're not satisfied with our careers.

You aren't satisfied?

Not really. I love acting but it's hard being so well-known.
Sometimes I just want to have a normal life and not this crazy one.

I didn't know you felt that way.

Sometimes I wonder what life would be like if I weren't an actress
And what if you weren't a lawyer?

That's a strange thought. But you have got me interested.


Lawyer ："嗨，Lily：。你怎么在这儿？"
Lily："我想说很抱歉毁了你的生日。我感觉糟透了。"
Lawyer："别这么说。你没有毁掉我的生日。"
Lily："本来我们玩得很开心，直到我的粉丝出现。"
Lawyer："别担心，我没有生你的气。"
Lily："但我还是感到内疚。我的演艺事业妨碍了我们的友谊。"
Lawyer："真的没关系。"
Lily："抱歉我没能更多陪伴你！"
Lawyer："我们都有繁忙的工作。我也错过了你生命中很多重要时刻。"
Lily："确实。昨晚吃饭时你说感觉很累。"
Lawyer："我太忙了，完全没有空闲时间。"
Lily： "听起来我们对事业都不太满意？"
Lawyer： "你不满意吗？"
Lily："不算真的满意。我喜欢表演，但成名很辛苦。
       有时我只想要普通生活，而不是这种疯狂的日子。"
Lawyer： "我不知道你有这种感受。"
Lily： "有时我想如果我不是演员生活会怎样？如果你不是律师呢？"
Lawyer： "这想法很奇特。但让我很感兴趣。"

That's perfect! She will love that.
Could you wrap it up?
Thank you so much.
I really don't want to let her down.

Remember, if she doesn't like the camera, you can always send it back.

Good luck, young man.

## 听力课: 读懂登机牌

```txt
Every time you check in at the airport, you get an important piece of paper.
This paper is called a "boarding pass".
You need your boarding pass to go on your flight.
It has a lot of information on it.
Today, Dana is traveling for work.
Let's look at her boarding pass.

It has her full name.
It shows her last name, Smith, before her first name, Dana.
Always check your name.
The name on your boarding pass and on your passport should be the same.
The boarding pass also has all of her flight information: 
the flight number,where she is flying to, her gate number, and her boarding time.
Her flight number is 610.
She is flying to New York.
Her gate number is 3B.
Her boarding time is at 10:30 am.

She needs to arrive at the gate before the boarding time.
The boarding time is usually about 30 minutes before the airplane takes off.
This is her seat number and class.
She has a window seat.
She is flying economy class today.

每次在机场办理登机手续时，你都会拿到一张重要的纸。这张纸叫做"登机牌"。
你需要登机牌才能登机。上面有很多信息。今天Dana要出差。我们来看看她的登机牌。
上面有她的全名。姓氏Smith显示在名字Dana前面。一定要核对姓名。
登机牌上的姓名应该和护照上的一致。
登机牌还包含所有航班信息：航班号、目的地、登机口和登机时间。
她的航班号是610。她要飞往纽约。登机口是3B。登机时间是上午10:30。
她需要在登机时间前到达登机口。登机时间通常在飞机起飞前30分钟左右。
这是她的座位号和舱位等级。她有一个靠窗座位。今天她乘坐的是经济舱。
```

## 口语课: 网上办理登机

```txt
I should go to bed soon. I'm flying to Canada early in the morning.

That's a good idea. Did you check in online?

No, should I?

Oh yes, when you check in online you can choose your seat, or change your class. 
Then tomorrow you can just wake up and get on the plane.

Do I need my passport number?

No, you just need your flight number, first name, and surname.

Great, I'll go do that now.

A: 我该早点睡觉了。明天一大早就要飞加拿大。
B: 这是个好主意。你网上值机了吗？
A: 没有，需要吗？
B: 当然需要啊，网上值机可以选座位，还能改舱位。这样明天起床就能直接登机了。
A: 需要护照号码吗？
B: 不用，只需要航班号、名字和姓氏就行。
A: 太好了，我现在就去办。

Hi Emily, I'm calling to tell you that my flight is delayed.

Oh no, why?

There's a lot of fog right now. We got on the plane, but it couldn't take off. 
Right now we're back at the gate.

I'm sorry to hear that. Please call me when you land. 
Then, I'll come pick you up!

Good idea. Oh.. my phone battery is low right now. I'm going to turn my phone off.

Ok, good luck!

A: 嗨Emily，我打电话是想告诉你我的航班延误了。
B: 哦不，为什么啊？
A: 现在雾很大。我们都已经登机了，但飞机无法起飞。现在我们又回到登机口了。
B: 听到这个消息我很遗憾。你落地后请给我打电话。到时候我去接你！
A: 好主意。哦...我的手机现在电量低了。我要关机了。
B: 好的，祝你好运！

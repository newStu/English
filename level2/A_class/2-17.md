What are you doing, Paul?

I'm looking for a new apartment on the Web.

Ah, what kind of apartment?

Well... I want one that is not as expensive as this apartment.
I also want one with a washing machine and a nice stove.

Do you want to live close to work?

Yes. I would like to ride my bicycle to work, so that would be great, Steve.

You should look in my neighborhood.
My neighborhood is closer to work than yours.
It is also not as expensive!

Wow, Steve! Your new place looks great!
It's much bigger than mine.

Thanks. But it isn't as modern as yours.
Also, mine doesn't have heating or air-conditioning.

You know whose apartment is really modern?
Christina's. Hers is brand new.

That's true. However, hers doesn't have a cool rooftop Yours does.

Your parents' place has a garage and a laundry room.
So think theirs is cooler than all of ours.


哇，史蒂夫！你的新住处看起来真棒！
它比我的大多了。
谢谢。但它不如你的现代化。
而且我的没有暖气或空调。
你知道谁的公寓真的很现代化吗？
克里斯蒂娜的。她的公寓是全新的。
这倒是。不过她的没有酷炫的屋顶露台，你的有。
你父母的房子有车库和洗衣房。
所以我觉得他们的比我们所有人的都酷。

Hey you! I have some good news.
I told a friend of mine about your apartment hunt.

She talked to a friend of hers last night.
That friend and his wife have lots of buildings around town.
One building of theirs has an empty apartment.

It's in a great neighborhood, too.
Some old neighbors of mine moved there last year.
So, are you interested?


嘿！告诉你个好消息。
我跟我的一个朋友说了你在找公寓的事。
她昨晚和她的一个朋友聊了聊。
那个朋友和他妻子在城里有很多栋建筑。
他们有栋楼里正好有空公寓。
而且那个社区很棒。
我的一些老邻居去年也搬去了那里。
所以，你有兴趣吗？

Hey, Meg, are you from New York?

Oh, really? Where were you born?

I was born in Toronto.

So you were born in Canada?

Yeah, that's right.

Wow. How long did you live there?

I lived there until I was ten years old, from 1993 to 2003.
Then I moved to the US with my parents.

Did you move to New York?

No, we moved to Los Angeles first.
We stayed there for three years.
Then we moved to New York.

## 听力课: 洛杉矶和纽约

In the US, Los Angeles is on the West Coast and New York City is on the East Coast.

Both LA and New York are big cities, but life in LA and
New York is really different.

Meet my friend, Andrea.

She is a New Yorker because she was born in New York.

Two years ago, she moved from New York to Los Angeles.

She took the subway everyday in New York, but in LA she had to buy a car.

Everybody needs a car in LA and the traffic is really bad.

Andrea spends a lot of money on gas going to and from work.

She also spends a lot of time driving on the LA freeways.

Yet, on the bright side, the sun is always shining in LA.

Andrea goes to the beach on the weekends and holidays with her new friends.

So, what about you?

Would you rather live in LA or New York City?



在美国，洛杉矶位于西海岸，而纽约市位于东海岸。
洛杉矶和纽约都是大城市，但生活在洛杉矶和纽约却大不相同。
这是我的朋友Andrea。
她是个纽约人，因为她出生在纽约。
两年前，她从纽约搬到了洛杉矶。
她在纽约时每天坐地铁，但在洛杉矶她不得不买了一辆车。
在洛杉矶，每个人都需要一辆车，而且交通非常糟糕。
Andrea在上下班的路上要花很多钱在汽油上。
她还要花很多时间在洛杉矶的高速公路上开车。
不过，也有好的一面：洛杉矶总是阳光明媚。
Andrea会在周末和假期和她的新朋友一起去海滩。
那么，你呢？
你更愿意住在洛杉矶还是纽约市？

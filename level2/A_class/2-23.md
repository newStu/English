Kate, can you come over? I woke up with a terrible fever and I'm by myself.

Of course! I'll be right over. Dana's not there?

No. She and I usually take care of each other, but she's away this week.

Are the kids by themselves at school? Shall I pick them up?

No, they can walk themselves home. Could you bring us dinner, though?

Unfortunately, I don't have time. You'll have to cook something yourselves.

不用，他们可以自己走回家。不过你能给我们带晚饭吗？

## 听力课: 旅行医疗保险

```txt
Traveling is both fun and interesting.
But what if you get sick when traveling?

Last summer, my friend and I traveled to Las Vegas.
On the first two days, everything was fine.
We had a great time and ate a lot of good food.

On the third day, however, my friend didn't feel well.
She had a terrible stomachache.
We could not travel anymore.

Instead, I took her to the hospital.
Seeing a doctor is very expensive in the US.
But my friend had travel health insurance.
So, she didn't spend too much money while in the hospital.

If you are going to travel in the US,
it's important to buy travel health insurance for yourself.
This can save you a lot of money if you get sick.
And, it's important to stay in good health while traveling!

旅行既有趣又精彩。 但如果在旅途中生病了怎么办？
去年夏天，我和朋友去了拉斯维加斯旅行。
前两天一切都很好。 我们玩得很开心，吃了很多美食。
然而到了第三天，我朋友突然感觉不适。
她胃痛得厉害。 我们不得不中断行程。
我只好带她去医院。 在美国看病非常昂贵。
幸好她买了旅行医疗保险。 所以在医院没花太多钱。
如果你计划去美国旅行，一定要为自己购买旅行医疗保险。
万一生病能省下不少钱。 而且，旅行时保持健康也很重要！

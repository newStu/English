Hi, Doctor Lee. I want to get healthier. How can I do that?

Easy. First, start eating well. Don't eat fried foods,
eat healthy foods like salad!

Next, exercise more often. And don't forget to warm up and stretch!

Finally, sleep for eight hours a night. Read a book to relax before bed.

Oh, and one more thing: if you smoke, stop smoking! Take care, Mike.


李医生您好，我想变得更健康，该怎么做呢？
很简单。首先，要注意健康饮食。别吃油炸食品，多吃沙拉这类健康食物！
接着，要增加锻炼频率。别忘了运动前要热身和拉伸！
最后，每晚保证8小时睡眠。睡前可以看书放松一下。
哦还有一件事：如果你吸烟的话，赶紧戒掉！保重，Mike。

## 听力课: 锻炼四不做

```txt
I'm Coach Marco from Good Gym.
Today, I'm going to tell you about four workout mistakes.

Mistake #1: Not warming up and cooling down.
It's important to take a few minutes to stretch before and after a workout.
It helps your muscles get ready for exercise so your body doesn't get hurt later.

Mistake #2: Not taking care of yourself.
If you go to the gym hungry or sleepy, you might not have a good workout.
Get enough sleep, and eat two hours before your workout.

Mistake #3: Not drinking enough water.
Drink pure water during workouts.
Do not drink sports drinks. Sports drinks have a lot of sugar.

Mistake #4: Not resting enough.
Regular workouts are good for your health.

But, don't work out every day.
Give your muscles time to rest and recover.
For safe workouts, please do not make these mistakes!
Until next week... see you then!


我是来自Good Gym的Marco教练。 今天我要告诉你四个常见的锻炼误区。
误区一：不做热身和放松 在锻炼前后花几分钟时间做拉伸非常重要。
这能让你的肌肉为运动做好准备，避免后续身体受伤。
误区二：不注重自身状态 如果你饥饿或困倦时去健身房，可能不会有好的锻炼效果。
保证充足睡眠，并在锻炼前两小时进食。
误区三：饮水不足 锻炼期间要喝纯净水。 不要喝运动饮料，运动饮料含糖量很高。
误区四：休息不足 定期锻炼对健康有益。 但是，不要每天都锻炼。
要给肌肉时间休息和恢复。 为了安全锻炼，请避免这些误区！ 下周见！

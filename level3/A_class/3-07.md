## 听力课：你吸猫还是吸狗？

```txt
Are you a "cat person" or a "dog person"?

A cat person is someone who prefers cats over dogs.

And you guessed it: a dog person is someone who prefers dogs over cats.

Your very quiet, neighbor who owns four cats, for example,
is defnitely a cat person.

What about the really easygoing professor whose
beloved golden retriever goes with him everywhere?

He's a dog person, for sure.

In fact, several studies suggest that there are big differences
between "cat people" and "dog people".

But what are these differences?

Cat people may be more introverted, or quiet and private.

Dog people are more extroverted, or talkative and easygoing.

Research shows that cat people are thought to be more open-minded,
creative,and artistic than dog people.

But the study also found that dog people are more agreeable, loving,
and sociable than cat people.


你是"猫派"还是"狗派"？
猫派是指喜欢猫胜过狗的人。
你猜对了：狗派是指喜欢狗胜过猫的人。

例如，你那个非常安静、养了四只猫的邻居，肯定是猫派。
那那个非常好相处的教授呢？他心爱的金毛猎犬无论去哪里都跟着他。
他肯定是狗派。
事实上，几项研究表明，"猫派"和"狗派"之间存在很大差异。
但这些差异是什么呢？

猫派可能更内向，或安静和私密。
狗派更外向，或健谈和好相处。
研究表明，与狗派相比，猫派被认为更加开放、有创造力和艺术天赋。
但这项研究也发现，与猫派相比，狗派更和蔼、有爱心和善于社交。

## 口语课：看兽医

```txt
Hi Brandon, how can I help you today?

My parrot has a really serious problem.

What is it? Does he have an illness?

No, he won't stop talking!

Brandon... that's not a disease.

Well it's a pretty big problem.
I can't sleep because he talks all night long.
And he bothers my roommate too.
Is there a shot you can give him? Or anoperation you can do?

No, Brandon. My job is to protect animals,not to train them.

Well, what do you recommend I do?

Like I said, I'm not a professional parrot trainer.
But maybe he talks because he's anxious.
Try to let him out of his cage more often.
Maybe then he'll behave better.

Hmmm, that's not a bad idea.
I'll try it tonight.
Thanks for your help!

You're welcome Brandon.
Don't forget to pay your bill at the front desk.

A：嗨，布兰登，今天我能帮你什么忙？
B：我的鹦鹉有一个非常严重的问题。
A：是什么问题？它生病了吗？
B：不，它不停地说话！
A：布兰登...这不是疾病。
B：但这确实是个大问题。我睡不着觉，因为它整夜都在说话。
   而且它也打扰我的室友。你能给它打一针吗？或者给它做个手术？
A：不，布兰登。我的工作是保护动物，而不是训练它们。
B：那你觉得我该怎么做？
A：就像我说的，我不是专业的鹦鹉训练师。但也许它说话是因为焦虑。
   试着让它更经常出笼子。也许这样它会表现得更好。
B：嗯，这主意不错。我今晚就试试。谢谢你的帮助！
A：不客气，布兰登。别忘了在前台付账。

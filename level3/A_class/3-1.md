## 语法课：a/an/the 的用法

```txt
Are you a pet owner?
If you have a pet, there is something that you should know.

The food that you like is not always the best food for your pet.
For example, kittens can't drink cow's milk.
Another kind of milk is a better choice - goat's milk!

Chocolate is another dangerous food.
Do not feed chocolate to dogs.
It can cause them health problems.

It's an excellent idea to check on the internet before you give human food to pets.
It might not be safe.


你是宠物主人吗？
如果你有宠物，有一些事情你应该知道。
你喜欢的食物并不总是最适合宠物的食物。
例如，小猫不能喝牛奶。
另一种牛奶是更好的选择——山羊奶！
巧克力是另一种危险的食物。
不要给狗喂巧克力。
这可能会导致它们出现健康问题。
在给宠物喂食人类食物之前，上网查一查是个好主意。
它可能并不安全。

## 词汇课: 宠物用品

Getting a pet is exciting, and to get ready, you need a lot of **supplies**.

Supplies are items or **materials** that people need to do a task.

Where do you usually get your pet supplies online or in store?

That village **is running low** on medical supplies.

Check online for tips on choosing the perfect dog **collar** or getting the best **litter** box for your kitten.

Should my dog always wear a collar when I take it out for a walk?

An **automatic litter box** saves time and is easy to clean up.

It is important to make sure your pet feels comfortable. For example,if you get a parrot,you need to pick a **cage** that is big enough for it to move around.

A parrot is a bright-colored bird that can be trained to repeat what you say.

In that movie, he has a parrot on his **shoulder** wherever he goes.

A cage is a place with **bars** where animals are kept.

Do you think it's right for a zoo to keep all animals in cages?

养一只宠物令人兴奋，为了做好准备，你需要准备很多用品。 <br/>
“Supplies” 是指人们完成一项任务所需的物品或材料。 <br/>
你通常是在网上还是在实体店购买宠物用品？ <br/>
那个村庄的医疗物资正在逐渐短缺。 <br/>
可以在线查找如何选择完美的狗项圈，或者为你的小猫挑选最佳猫砂盆的建议。 <br/>
当我带狗出去散步时，它应该一直戴着项圈吗？ <br/>
自动猫砂盆节省时间，而且清理起来很方便。 <br/>
确保宠物感到舒适是很重要的。例如，如果你养了一只鹦鹉， <br/>
你需要挑选一个足够大的笼子，让它可以在里面自由活动。 <br/>
鹦鹉是一种颜色鲜艳、可以被训练模仿人类说话的鸟。 <br/>
在那部电影里，他无论去哪里，肩上都有一只鹦鹉。 <br/>
笼子是一个有栏杆的地方，用来关动物。 <br/>
你认为动物园把所有动物都关在笼子里对吗？ <br/>

## 词汇课: 迎接新宠物

The excitement of having a new member of the family is usually **accompanied**
by worries and **confusion**.

To accompany means to happen at the same time.

Her letter was accompanied by two photos.

To accompany can also mean to go someplace with somebody.

The lamb accompanies the little girl everywhere.

To be one's **company** means to be with someone so they don't feel lonely.

Her parents bought her a lamb for company.

After you bring home a new cat, show it where the litter box is and train it not to scratch your furniture.

Kittens like to **scratch**.

The puppy scratched at the door because he couldn't wait to go out for a walk.

迎接一个新家庭成员所带来的兴奋，通常伴随着担忧和困惑。 <br/>
“Accompany” 的意思是“同时发生”。 <br/>
例如：她寄来的信里附带了两张照片。 <br/>
“Accompany” 还可以表示“陪同某人去某个地方”。 <br/>
这只小羊羔无论去哪里都跟着那个小女孩。 <br/>
“To be one's company” 意思是陪伴某人，让他们不感到孤单。 <br/>
她的父母买了一只小羊羔来陪伴她。 <br/>
当你把一只新猫带回家后，要告诉它猫砂盆的位置，并训练它不要抓挠家具。 <br/>
小猫喜欢抓东西。 <br/>
小狗抓挠门是因为它迫不及待地想出去散步。 <br/>

Make sure you **groom** your cats or dogs **regularly** and take them to the vet for health checks.

If you groom an animal, you wash and clean it to make it look better.

Grooming not only makes your pet pretty, but also keeps it healthy.

Kittens and puppies can grow attached to you in two or three days.

To **grow attached to** means to start loving something or someone a lot.

The little girl grew attached to her baby sitter after three months.

Once you win your pet's love and trust, it will become your most **reliable** friend.

People or things that are reliable can be believed to work well.

He is very reliable. If he says he will dosomething, he will do it.

确保你定期给猫或狗梳理毛发，并带它们去兽医那里做健康检查。 <br/>
如果你给动物梳洗，就是给它们洗澡、清洁，让它们看起来更整洁。 <br/>
梳理毛发不仅能让你的宠物更漂亮，也有助于保持它们的健康。 <br/>
小猫和小狗在一两天内就可能对你产生感情。 <br/>
“Grow attached to” 表示开始非常喜欢某人或某物。 <br/>
那个小女孩三个月后对她的姐姐产生了感情。 <br/>
一旦赢得了宠物的爱与信任，它就会成为你最可靠的朋友。 <br/>
“Reliable” 是指某人或某物值得信赖、工作良好。 <br/>
他非常可靠。如果他说他会做某事，他就一定会做到。 <br/>

## 听力课: 小狗狗也是宝宝

```txt
Babies and puppies are actually quite similar when it comes to sounds,
sleeping, and loving their parents and owners.

While adult dogs might not like human "baby talk", puppies do !

Many parents use a similar style of baby talk when speaking to their newborns.

Both puppies and babies need and love their sleep!

Puppies spend about 14 hours of the day sleeping.

Compare that to newborn babies who spend 16 to 17 hours per day sleeping.

Puppies, just like babies with their parents, often grow attached to their owners.

While it takes a lot of time to care for a puppy, puppies give a lo of
love back to their owners.

It's no wonder why so many humans fall in love with their puppies.


在声音、睡眠以及对父母或主人的依恋方面，婴儿和小狗其实有很多相似之处。
虽然成年狗可能不喜欢人类对婴儿使用的“儿语”，但幼犬却喜欢。
许多父母在跟新生儿说话时会使用类似的儿语方式。
无论是幼犬还是婴儿，都需要并热爱睡觉！
幼犬每天大约有14个小时在睡觉。
相比之下，新生儿每天要睡16到17个小时。
就像婴儿依恋父母一样，幼犬也常常会对它们的主人产生感情。
尽管照顾一只幼犬需要花费很多时间，但它们也会给予主人很多爱。
难怪那么多人都会爱上自己的小狗。
```

## 口语课：我们养只小狗吧

```
Hi, Jane. Guess what? I'm going to get us a pet!

Really? Brandon, I don't think buying a pet is a good decision.

Why not? I've always wanted a puppy.

You don't know how to take care of a dog.

It can't be that hard. Lots of people have puppies.

Well, you have to walk the dog every day, take him to the vet when he's sick,
and feed him when he's hungry.
You also have to train him, which is a lot of work!

You're right. That does sound like a lot of things to do...

Why don't you get an animal that's easier to take care of.

Like what?

Like... like... a parrot. Parrots are much easier than dogs to take care of.

That's a really good idea!


嗨，简。你猜怎么着？我打算给我们买一只宠物！
真的吗？布兰登，我觉得买宠物不是一个好决定。
为什么不行？我一直想要一只小狗。
你不了解怎么照顾狗。
这应该不会太难吧。很多人养小狗啊。
嗯，你得每天遛狗，狗生病的时候要带它去看兽医，它饿了还要喂它。
你还得训练它，这可是一件很费劲的事！
你说得对，听起来确实有很多事情要做……
那你为什么不养一种更容易照顾的动物呢？
比如什么？
比如说……一只鹦鹉。鹦鹉比狗容易照顾多了。
这是个非常好的主意！
```

## 口语课: 宠物鹦鹉

```txt
Hello, how can I help you?

Hi, I'd like to get a parrot. But I've never had one before.
And I'd like to learn how to take care of parrots.

Sure. To start with, feed them twice a day, but don't give them too much food.

OK, I can do that. Anything else I need to know?

You should let them out of the cage from time to time, or they might get upset.

I see. Parrots are easy to train, right?
I really want a parrot that can talk.

Well, baby birds are usually easy to train.

Cool! Can you show me how to do it?

Sure! This way, please.


你好，有什么可以帮你的吗？
你好，我想买一只鹦鹉。但我以前从来没有养过鹦鹉，
我想了解一下怎么照顾它们。
当然可以。首先，每天喂它们两次，但不要给太多食物。
好的，我可以做到。还有其他需要注意的吗？
你应该时不时把它们从笼子里放出来，否则它们可能会感到烦躁。
我明白了。鹦鹉容易训练，对吧？
我真的很想要一只可以说话的鹦鹉。
嗯，幼鸟通常比较容易训练。
太酷了！你能教我怎么训练吗？
当然可以！请这边走。

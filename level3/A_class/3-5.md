Are you Dan?

Yes, are you Hannah?

Yes, I'm Hannah. It's nice to meet you.

It's nice to meet you, too!
I've heard a lot of great things about you from Tom.

I've heard a lot about you, too, and I've been looking forward to our dinner.

Me, too! I hope this restaurant is okay.
None of the other places near here had any reservations for tonight.

It's great. Thanks for making the plans.

To be honest, I'm feeling pretty nervous!

Don't worry. First dates make me nervous, too.
Anyway enough of that subject! (不说这这个话题了)
It was great talking to you on the phone last night.

Same here! I've never met anyone who likes jazz music as much as I do.

Well... I've been playing the violin since I was ten.

You know, I started playing the saxophone when I was ten, too.

Nice! Only half of my musician friends started playing music at a young age.

So how did you get interested in jazz music?

My grandfather was a professional violinist in a Big Band orchestra.
And he gave me all of these jazz records.  How about you?

I joined the jazz band in high school.
I found that I really liked performing and playing jazz.

Do you still perform live?

I do. Actually, we have a show next Saturday.
Would you like to come? I can get you a ticket.

Sure. I'd love to see you play.

Hannah：你是Dan吗？
Dan： 是的，你是 Hannah吗？
Hannah：是的，我是 Hannah。很高兴认识你。
Dan： 我也很高兴认识你！我听汤姆说了很多关于你的好话。
Hannah：我也听说过很多关于你的事，一直很期待我们的晚餐。
Dan： 我也是！希望这家餐厅还行。附近其他店今晚都没订到位子。
Hannah：挺好的。谢谢你安排计划。说实话，我挺紧张的！
Dan： 别担心。第一次约会我也紧张。不说这个了！昨晚和你打电话很开心。
Hannah：我也是！从没遇到过像我这么喜欢爵士乐的人。
Dan： 嗯...我从十岁就开始拉小提琴了。
Hannah：巧了，我也是十岁开始吹萨克斯的。
Dan： 不错！我搞音乐的朋友里只有一半是小时候开始学的。
Hannah：那你怎么对爵士乐感兴趣的？
Dan： 我祖父是Big Band乐团的职业小提琴手，他给了我很多爵士唱片。你呢？
Hannah：高中时加入了爵士乐队，发现自己真的很喜欢演奏爵士乐。
Dan： 你现在还现场演出吗？
Hannah：演啊。其实下周六我们有场演出，要来看吗？我能给你弄张票。
Dan： 好啊，很想看你表演。

## 听力课: 完美配对

```txt
How do most couples meet each other in today's busy world?
In previous generations, couples mostly met through their families and friends.
Since the mid-2000's, however, couples began to meet more and more
through the Internet.
The Pew Research Center reports that as of 2016, 15% of U.S. adults had used
dating apps or online dating sites.

在当今这个忙碌的世界里，大多数情侣是如何相识的？
在过去，情侣们主要通过家人和朋友介绍认识。
但从2000年代中期开始，越来越多情侣开始在互联网上相识。
`The Pew`研究中心报告显示，截至2016年，15%的美国成年人使用过交友软件或在线约会网站。

While Americans used to view internet dating as negative, attitudes have changed.
Today, most Americans don't think negatively
of online dating sites and dating apps.
Since the Internet has helped many couples to find love,
more and more different types of dating apps are appearing all of the time.

尽管美国人曾对网恋持负面看法，但态度已经改变。
如今，大多数美国人不再对在线约会网站和交友软件抱有偏见。
由于互联网已帮助许多情侣找到真爱，各种不同类型的交友软件正层出不穷地涌现。

Some of these dating apps are for certain groups of people.
Perhaps the thinking is that these apps will help people find a more perfect match.
For example, there is one dating app that is only for sports fans.
There is another one only for vegetarians and yet another one just
people who love dogs.
Would you try any of these apps?

其中一些交友软件是为特定人群设计的。
或许开发者认为这类软件能帮助人们找到更完美的匹配。
例如：
 有一款专为体育爱好者设计的交友软件
 有一款只为素食主义者服务的软件
 还有一款专为爱狗人士打造的软件
你会尝试使用这些软件吗？

Did you enjoy the dinner?

Oh yeah, the restaurant was great. I love Sichuan food.

That's good to hear. I really liked it too.

Hey, you said we could go to a concert after dinner.
When does it start?

Soon. If we start walking to Lincoln Center now though,
we'll have plenty of time to get a seat.

Lincoln Center? Is that where the concert is?

Of course. That's where all the professional orchestras perform.

Oh... an orchestra? To be honest, I thought we were going to a pop concert.

A pop concert? That's just entertainment.

My uncle was a professional pianist in an orchestra.
He taught me that classical music is the most beautiful sound in the world.

Well I am really fond of music.
I just can't pay attention to classical music for a long time.
It's a bit boring for me.

Maybe we should skip the concert then..

Sorry I don't mean to have a negative attitude.
I just don't think it would be very fun for me.
Were you looking forward to it?

No, no, it's fine. Anyway, at least you enjoyed the restaurant.

Yeah, thanks for that... so, anyway, I should get going.

Sure, Let's... uh... keep in touch.

A: 晚餐吃得开心吗？
B: 很棒啊，这家餐厅太好了。我超爱川菜。
A: 听你这么说真好。我也特别喜欢。
B: 对了，你说饭后可以去听音乐会。几点开始？
A: 快了。如果我们现在走去林肯中心，时间绰绰有余能占到好位置。
B: 林肯中心？音乐会在那儿举办？
A: 当然。所有专业管弦乐队都在那里演出。
B: 哦...管弦乐队？说实话，我以为我们要去流行演唱会。
A: 流行演唱会？那只是娱乐表演。
   我叔叔是交响乐团的职业钢琴家，他告诉我古典音乐才是世界上最美的声音。
B: 我确实很喜欢音乐，但古典乐实在没法长时间集中注意力听，对我来说有点无聊...
A: 那要不我们别去音乐会了...
B: 抱歉，我不是故意态度消极。只是觉得可能不会很有趣。你很期待吗？
A: 没事没事，至少餐厅合你胃口。
B: 是啊，谢谢安排...那...我先走了？
A: 好，我们...呃...保持联系。
```

## 口语课: 与好友谈论约会

```txt
Did you enjoy your date with Greg?

Not really.

What happened?

I didn't like his attitude. I'm a big fan of pop music,
but he said it's not as good as classical music.

Oh, Brandon told me that Greg is fond of classical music.
Maybe you can give it a try.

I'm not sure about that. Classical music is just not my thing.
Greg talked like I don't have enough taste to understand classical music.
That hurt my feelings.

Maybe he is just bad at talking with girls.
So... other than music, you two must have something else in common.

Well... we both like Sichuan food.
But to be honest, I don't think we will get along.

A: 你和Greg的约会愉快吗？
B: 并不愉快。
A: 发生了什么？
B: 我不喜欢他的态度。我是一个流行音乐的狂热爱好者，但他说流行音乐不如古典音乐好。
A: 哦，Brandon告诉我Greg很喜欢古典音乐。也许你可以尝试一下。
B: 我不确定。古典音乐不是我喜欢的类型。
   Greg说话的方式让我觉得他认为我没有足够的品味来理解古典音乐。这让我感到受伤。
A: 也许他只是不擅长和女孩交谈。那么...除了音乐，你们一定还有其他共同点。
B: 嗯...我们都喜欢四川菜。但说实话，我不认为我们能相处得来。

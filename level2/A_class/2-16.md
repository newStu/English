I want to visit a museum here in London.
Should I go to the Tate Modern or the National Gallery?

Go to the Tate. The National Gallery is cheaper,
but the Tate is more interesting.

Does it have more photography than the National Gallery?

Yes, it does. But the National Gallery has older art than the Tate.

The Tate is also more comfortable to visit,
because it's less popular. If you go, you'll have a great time!

去泰特吧。国家美术馆更便宜，但泰特更有趣。
泰特的摄影作品比国家美术馆更多吗？ 是的。不过国家美术馆的艺术品比泰特的更古老。
泰特参观起来也更舒适，因为那里没那么拥挤。如果你去的话，一定会玩得很开心！

Hey, can I give you some advice? Don't go in there.
There's a better restaurant across the street.
My older brother took me there once.

They have fresher food and friendlier waiters.
They have more comfortable seating, too.

Or, you can find less expensive options over in Soho.
If you want more international food, that's the place to go.
Good luck and happy eating!

马路对面有家更好的餐厅。我哥哥带我去过一次。
他们的食材更新鲜，服务员也更友善， 座位也更舒适。
或者，你可以去苏活区找些更实惠的选择。
如果你想尝试更多国际美食，那里是最佳去处。 祝你好胃口！"

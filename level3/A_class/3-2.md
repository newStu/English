Wow, what a delightful restaurant!

Thanks for taking me out for my birthday.

No problem. How was your day?

Today was really tiring, actually.

What did you do?

Well, after taking part in meetings all morning, I met with two clients,
and then wrote several reports.

Sounds like you had a busy birthday.

Yeah, I did. Actually, work has been crazy for several months now.
What about you? How has your work been?

Really good. I just finished my latest movie.

Well done!

Thanks! Now let's pick some wine to share before ordering our dinner.

This is great. A fun night out is just what I needed.

Uh-oh.I think some fans saw that I'm here.
They are looking at us through the window.

Oh no, are they going to cause a problem?

Well, it's only a few people, so everything should be fine.
I'll just quickly go outside and take some pictures with them.

Um, Lily. I think it's more than a few. It looks like there
are a lot of people outside.

Oh no! I'm sorry, Margo, but I think more and more fans will keep showing up.
We probably should go...


哇，这真是一家令人愉快的餐厅！
谢谢你生日这天带我出来。
不客气。你今天过得怎么样？
其实今天非常累。
你都做了些什么？
整个上午都在开会，之后见了两位客户，然后写了好几份报告。
听起来你的生日过得很忙碌啊。
是啊。事实上，这几个月工作一直都很忙。
那你呢？你最近的工作怎么样？
非常好。我刚刚完成了我最新的电影。
太棒了！
谢谢！现在我们来选一瓶酒，等下配晚餐一起喝。
这真是太好了。一场轻松愉快的夜晚正是我所需要的。
啊哦，我想有些粉丝发现我在这里了。
他们正透过窗户看着我们。
啊？他们会惹出什么麻烦吗？
嗯，只是几个人的话，应该没问题。
我去外面快速和他们拍几张照片就好。
呃，Lily，我觉得不止几个人。看起来外面已经聚集很多人了。
糟糕！对不起，Margo，我觉得会有越来越多的粉丝过来。
我们可能得先走了……

Do you know what it's like to be a pet owner?
Let me tell you about life with my lovely cats and dogs.

Every morning, after making coffee, I feed them.
Sometimes they are too hungry to wait and jump on the bed to wake me up.

I try to take my dogs for a walk before leaving for work.
If I don't do that, they'll be upset all day.
I have to walk them again after coming home in the evening.

Cats are easier. They take care of themselves.
I love my cats and dogs. I can't live without them.
Before getting a pet, come talk to me and I'll give you some advice!


你知道当宠物主人是什么感觉吗？
让我来告诉你我和我可爱的猫狗一起的生活。
每天早上泡好咖啡后，我会先喂它们。
有时候它们太饿了，等不及就会跳上床把我叫醒。
我尽量在上班前带狗狗去散步。
如果我不去，它们一整天都会很不开心。
晚上回家后我还得再带它们出去一次。
猫要省心一些，它们可以自己照顾自己。
我非常爱我的猫和狗，没有它们我无法生活。
如果你打算养宠物，来找我聊聊，我可以给你一些建议！

## 听力课：你想当明星吗？

```txt
Many people dream of being a celebrity.
Celebrities are famous, and have lots of fans and money.

But being a celebrity may not be as delightful as it sounds.
Many celebrities have no privacy.

Gossip magazines write about what they eat for breakfast,
and who they go to dinner with.

And no matter where they go, they'll be seen by fans.

There are even jobs that depend on bothering celebrities, like the paparazzi.

Paparazzi sell photos of celebrities after following them.

It seems like celebrities are watched both on and off the movie screen.

If you didn't have any privacy, would you want to be famous?


许多人梦想成为名人。名人很出名，拥有大量的粉丝和金钱。
但成为名人可能并不像听起来那么令人愉快。许多名人没有隐私。
八卦杂志会报道他们早餐吃了什么，以及他们和谁一起共进晚餐。
无论他们去哪里，都会被粉丝看到。

甚至有一些工作就是专门打扰名人，比如狗仔队（paparazzi）。
狗仔队跟踪名人并出售他们的照片。
看起来，名人无论是银幕上还是银幕下都处于被关注的状态。
如果你没有任何隐私，你还想出名吗？

Hey Greg! Can I ask you a favor?

Don't tell me you need more advice about your girlfriend.

What? No.I was just wondering if you still have your Netflix subscription.

I still do. why?

Well.. I want to watch the new season of Narcos, Narcos Mexico.
I just watched the trailer the other day.

Oh really? How do you feel about it?

The new season looks even more exciting.
We can watch it together tonight before going to bed. What do you say?

I don't know. Most sequels are terrible.

Well.. What's your take on the action film that came out recently?
I heard it's a real blockbuster.

Actually, I'm not much of a moviegoer.

Ouch, okay then. So, as we were saying about Netflix...

I'm sending you my account password now.

Thank you, buddy! I'll let you know after finishing it.


嘿 Greg！能帮我个忙吗？
别告诉我你又需要关于你女朋友的建议了。
什么？不是啦。我只是想问问你还有 Netflix 的会员吗？
我还有啊，怎么了？
嗯...我想看《毒枭》的新一季《毒枭：墨西哥》。前几天刚看了预告片。
真的吗？你觉得怎么样？
新一季看起来更刺激了。我们今晚睡觉前一起看怎么样？
我不知道...大多数续集都很烂。
那...你觉得最近上映的那部动作片怎么样？听说是个真正的大片。
其实我不怎么常看电影。
好吧...那说回 Netflix 的事...
我现在把账号密码发给你。
谢啦兄弟！看完我会告诉你观感的。

## 实义动词

**及物动词 vt ：动词后面需要加宾语**（t 像钩子后面要挂东西、i 不能挂）

| 及物动词类型 | 例子               | 解释                                       | 常见动词举例                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 单宾语       | I read a book.     | `a book` 是直接宾语，<br/>表示“读”的对象   | read、write、eat、<br/> drink、see、here、<br/> buy、sell、find、lose              |
| 双宾语       | I gave him a book. | `him` 是间接宾语，<br/>`a book` 是直接宾语 | give 、tell、show、<br/> send、teach、lend、offer、<br/> pass、promise、hand(递给) |
| 宾语补足语   | I make her happy.  | `her` 是宾语，<br/>`happy` 是宾语补足语    | make consider(认为)、call、<br/> find、paint、keep、<br/> think、name、feel        |

**不及物动词 vi ：动词后面无需加宾语 ， 如需加宾语就必须加介词**

run : He runs every morning. --> 无宾语<br/>
sleep : I sleep well. --> 无宾语<br/>
listen to : She listens to music every day. --> 加了介词 to 并跟了宾语 music

**有一类单词既可以做 vt 也可以做 vi ，如：want**

I want a book. / I want you promise. --> 直接加宾语<br/>
I want to invite you to my birthday party. --> 加了介词 to 并跟了宾语 invite you<br/>

**案例分析** : 找出 vt 和 vi

女 : Tom , I love you. <br/>
男 : Do you love me ? Maybe I don't deserve(值得) you. <br/>
女 : I want to invite you to my birthday party. <br/>
男 : Sorry , I don't want to go to you to your party. <br/>

> 及物动词 : love 、 deserve 、invite <br/>
> 不及物动词 : want 、go (动词后加了介词 to)

**4. 情态助动词系列**

## 情态动词

情态动词是一种本身有一定的词义，可以表示说话人的情绪，态度或语气的动词。但是情态动词不能单独作谓语 ，
只能和其他动词原形构成谓语 ，情态动词没有人称和单复数的变化。

<u>may -> might -> shall -> could -> can -> have to -> must </u> (从左至右，语气越来越强)

**情态动词三原则**

- **后面必须 + 动词原形**

  She <u>can</u> **speak** Spanish.

- **无三单**，情态动词不受主语的人称和数的影响，不会变化为第三人称单数形式（即不加-s）

  She <u>must</u> **study** hard.

- **否定 + not , 疑问提前**

  否定句 : They <u>shouldn't</u> **go** there. <br/>
  疑问句 ：<u>Should</u> They go there ?

## 非谓语动词

英语语法里，有这样“一个动词”的规定，一个句子里有且只能有一个谓语动词。
非谓语本质是不能做谓语的动词，可以作句子的其他成分，例如宾语、定语等等。

**非谓语动词的四种形态**

- **动名词 doing**

| 例句                                      | 谓语动词 | 非谓语动词    |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| I like eating steamed bun.(馒头)          | like     | eating 做宾语 |
| Eating steamed buns is my favorite thing. | is       | eating 做主语 |
| My favorite thing is eating steamed buns. | is       | eating 做表语 |

- **现在分词 doing**

| 例句                                                                      | 谓语动词        | 非谓语动词                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Being hungry, I ordered a take-out.                                       | ordered         | Being hungry 做状语          |
| He sat there, reading a newspaper.                                        | sat             | reading a newspaper 做状语   |
| Not **having** much money, <br/>I ordered only one steamed bun.(主动关系) | ordered         | Not having much money 做状语 |
| Not **given** enough time, <br/>I couldn't finish the work. (被动关系)    | couldn't finish | given 做状语                 |

- **过去分词 done**

【逻辑主语】非谓语动词逻辑上产生的虚拟主语。

思考：为什么一个用 Bitten 一个用 biting 呢?

**Bitten** by a fierce dog, the take out boy was so hurt that he can't say a word. <br/>
逻辑主语：the take out boy , 动作和主语是**被动**关系时 , 要用现在过去分词 **done** <br/>

However,**biting** the take-out boy, the fierce dog didn't feel sorry at all. <br/>
逻辑主语：the fierce dog , 动作和主语是**主动**关系时 , 要用现在分词 **doing** <br/>

- **不定式 to do**

To be, or not to be, that is the question. (生存还是毁灭，这是个问题)

## 两个有

- **have** : 某人有某物

  I have a dog.

- **There be** : 某地有某物

  There is a book on the desk. --> 单数 <br/>
  There is some water in the glass. --> 不可数 <br/>
  There are three pencils on the box. --> 复数 <br/>

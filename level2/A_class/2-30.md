## 听力课: 选择纪念品

```txt
When you are traveling, it is hard to choose the right gifts.
You want to buy souvenirs that people like.
Here are some ideas for choosing good souvenirs.
Art can be a great idea.
Say you visited Paris and would like to remember the Eiffel Tower.
Try to buy paintings of the tower.
That way your friends and family can also see the tower.

Another idea is to buy fashion.
Bring back something small like a hat or a scarf that your friends 
and family can wear.
They will have a special style.
If food was the best part about your trip, bring home some recipes.
You can make the food you liked in Paris at home.
For example, you can learn how to make delicious French chocolates.
You can share these chocolates with your friends and family.

旅行时选择合适的礼物并不容易。你想买别人喜欢的纪念品。  
以下是一些挑选好纪念品的建议：艺术品是个不错的选择。  
比如你去过巴黎，想纪念埃菲尔铁塔，可以买铁塔的画作。这样你的亲友也能欣赏到铁塔的美景。  
另一个主意是买时尚单品。带些小物件回来，比如帽子或围巾，让你的亲友可以穿戴。  
他们会拥有独特的风格。如果美食是你旅行的亮点，不妨带些食谱回家。  
你可以在家制作你在巴黎喜欢的美食。例如，你可以学习制作美味的法式巧克力，与亲友一起分享。

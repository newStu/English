     但是你确定你准备好没有我和爸爸陪同就出国了吗？
Ellen: 我觉得我准备好了，而且这是一个不容错过的好机会。
       我们的老师来选择哪些学生可以去！
       她从所有学生中选择了我和米娅。拜托妈妈！
Mom: 好吧，这确实是个好机会。你应该去。

## 口语课 : 毕业去向

Greg, this is your last semester at university.

I've been so busy that I haven't thought about it yet.

Well, do you want to start working? Or do you want to continue your education?

I'd like to go to graduate school, but I don't know if that's a good idea.

Why? There are such great opportunities at graduate schools.
You can even finish a master's degree while studying abroad.

Really?  I was so worried about opportunities in the U.S.,
that I didn't even consider studying abroad.
Then I suggest that you think about applying this year.

A: 格雷格，这是你在大学的最后一个学期了。你毕业后想做什么？
B: 这真是个很难回答的问题。我一直很忙，还没有考虑过这件事。

Hello? Greg? Are you home?

Yeah, I'm in the kitchen.

What are you doing indoors on such a nice day?
We should go out!

Now isn't a good time to go out.
I'm working on an application for grad school.

Grad school? That's a great opportunity!
I'm so excited for you!

Well don't be too excited.
I still need to submit the application.
I also have to register for an entrance exam.
If I get a score below 80 percent on the exam,
they won't even look at my application.

That sounds like a lot to think about.

Exactly. Even if I do get in, I'll still have to get a student visa,
and get the money to pay.

Wait, a student visa?

Yeah, I want to study abroad.
Paris has a really good AI program, and I'd really like to explore French culture.
I'm scared my application will be rejected though.

Well, then I suggest you come with me to the farmers market.
It'll help you to relax. Right now you're so anxious that you aren't working.

Are you sure going out will help?

For sure.

A: 喂？格雷格？你在家吗？
B: 是的，我在厨房。
A: 这么好的天气你待在屋里做什么？我们应该出去走走！
B: 现在不是出去的好时机。我在准备研究生院的申请。
A: 研究生院？那是个很好的机会！我真为你感到兴奋！
B: 别太兴奋了。我还得提交申请。我还必须注册参加入学考试。
   如果我在考试中得分低于百分之八十，他们甚至不会看我的申请。
A: 听起来要考虑的事情真不少。
B: 确实如此。即使我被录取了，我还得拿到学生签证，并且筹钱支付费用。
A: 等等，学生签证？
B: 是的，我想出国留学。巴黎有一个非常好的人工智能项目，我真的很想探索法国文化。
   不过我担心我的申请会被拒绝。
A: 那么，我建议你跟我一起去农贸市场。
   这会让你放松一下。你现在太焦虑了，反而无法好好工作。
B: 你确定出去走走会有帮助吗？
A: 当然确定。

## 听力课: 电影与零食 

```txt
Do you like to eat popcorn during the movies? // [!code focus:11]
Most people get popcorn or other snacks and soda at the movies.
A lot of people think popcorn and snacks are part of the movie experience.
But, did you know that, in the past, movie theaters didn't sell any popcorn or other snacks?
Food was often sold by other moviegoers or by people outside of the theater.
This only changed because movie theaters started to lose money.
To increase sales, movie theaters opened concession stands inside theaters.
Concession stands sell snacks such as candy, popcorn, and soft drinks.
These stands can be found in movie theaters, parks, and stadiums.
And, it worked!
Today, snacks are over 40 percent of the profits, or money, that theaters make.



你在看电影的时候喜欢吃爆米花吗?
大多数人在看电影时会买爆米花或者其它的零食和汽水。
许多人认为爆米花和零食是观影体验的一部分。
但是，你知道吗，在过去电影院并不出售任何爆米花或者其它零食?
食物经常是其它爱看电影的人或者电影院外面的人出售的。
这些改变仅仅是因为电影院开始亏损了。
为了增加销售额，电影院在其内部开设了小卖部。
小卖部出售零食，像糖果、爆米花和软饮料。
你可以在电影院、公园和体育场中找到这些小卖部。
并且，这奏效了!
现今，零食占比超过了电影院的利润，或者说赚到的钱的40%。

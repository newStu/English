# 2-15 这家酒店更新

## 综合课: 选择酒店

```txt
Christina, our trip is soon.
Which hotel should we stay at: Hotel Sky or Hotel Star?

Well... Hotel Sky is big, but Hotel Star is newer.
Hotel Star is also closer to the airport.

Yeah, but Hotel Sky is cheaper.
Which hotel has a better swimming pool?

Hmmm... I think Hotel Sky does, but the food there is worse.
The food at Hotel Star is better.

Okay, let's stay at Hotel Star because it's newer, 
closer to the airport, and it has better food.

Sounds good.


A: 克里斯蒂娜，我们很快就要去旅行了。该选哪家酒店好呢：天空酒店还是星辰酒店？
B: 嗯...天空酒店规模大，但星辰酒店更新一些。而且星辰酒店离机场也更近。
A: 是啊，不过天空酒店更便宜。哪家酒店的游泳池更好呢？
B: 我想想...应该是天空酒店，但那边的餐食比较差。星辰酒店的食物更好吃。
A: 好吧，我们还是选星辰酒店吧，因为它更新、离机场更近，而且食物更好。
B: 听起来不错。

## 听力课: 头等舱机票

```txt
Hello, everybody. I'm Johnny and this is the Johnny travel show!
Today, I'm going to fly first class from New York to Dubai.
This first-class ticket costs 20,000 dollars!
It's an expensive ticket, but first class is much better.

Follow me, and I'll show you what it's like to fly first class.
Wow, this is amazing!
I have my own room!
Look, there's a TV.
It's much bigger than the TV in my house.
There's also a fridge.
It's small. But, it has many drinks.

It's time for lunch.
Let me look at the menu.
I'll have the caviar.
Caviar is fish eggs and it's very expensive.
Umm, this is delicious.
Even a five-star restaurant's caviar isn't this good.

Check out this seat.
It can turn into a bed!
And it feels nicer than my own bed.
Now it's time to sleep.
Dubai!see you.


大家好，我是强尼，欢迎收看《强尼旅行秀》！今天我要乘坐纽约飞往迪拜的头等舱，
这张机票要2万美元呢！虽然价格昂贵，但头等舱体验绝对物超所值。
跟着我一起感受头等舱的魅力吧！哇，太惊艳了！我居然有私人包间！看这台电视，
比我家里的还要大不少。还有个迷你冰箱，虽然不大但饮料种类丰富。
午餐时间到，让我看看菜单。我要点鱼子酱，这种用鱼卵做的美食价格不菲。
嗯...真是美味！连五星级餐厅的鱼子酱都比不上这个味道。
看看这个座椅，居然能变成一张床！舒适度比我自家的床还要好。现在该休息啦，迪拜见！

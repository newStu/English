## 综合课 ： 另一种生活

```txt
Lily, over here!

I'm so glad you could meet me for lunch.

I'll take any opportunity I can get to see you.
You're always so busy!

Ugh, I know. I've worked late almost every night this month.

How is work going?

Not that well.
I really don't enjoy being a secretary.
The work is so dull.

Sure, but that's pretty normal.
Nearly all jobs are boring.

Yeah, but I just feel so unimportant and I don't want to feel that way.
Even if I do something excellent, no one ever cares.

That sounds terrible.
I'm sure you are great at your job.

But my boss doesn't think so.
No matter what I do, he is never pleased with my work.

Alright, let's change the subject.
Did you watch that new comedy "Modern Love"?

I did. Wasn't the leading actress amazing?
Watching her makes me want to take up acting again.

I still remember how outstanding you were in our high school play.

Thanks. I really wish I hadn't given up my dream of being an actress.

Well, it's not too late.
Why don't you just pick up where you left off?

朋友：莉莉，在这里！
朋友：我很高兴你能和我一起吃午饭。
朋友：我会抓住任何能见到你的机会。你总是这么忙！
莉莉：唉，我知道。这个月我几乎每晚都加班到很晚。
朋友：工作怎么样？
莉莉：不太好。我真的不喜欢当秘书。这工作太无聊了。
朋友：当然，但那是正常的。几乎所有工作都很无聊。
莉莉：是的，但我就是觉得自己这么不重要，我不想那样感觉。即使我做得很好，也没人关心。
朋友：听起来很糟糕。我相信你在工作中很棒。
莉莉：但我的老板不这么认为。无论我做什么，他对我的工作都不满意。
朋友：好吧，我们换个话题。你看了那部新喜剧《现代爱情》吗？
莉莉：看了。女主角不是很棒吗？看她表演让我想重新开始演戏。
朋友：我还记得你在高中戏剧中表现得多么出色。
莉莉：谢谢。我真希望我没有放弃当演员的梦想。
朋友：嗯，现在还不晚。为什么不从你离开的地方继续呢？

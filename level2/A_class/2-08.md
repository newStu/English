## 听力课: 最特别的礼物

```txt
Hello, I'm Miranda.
Welcome to Liulishuo Live English.
Today we're asking people on the street,
"What is the most special gift you've ever received?"
Hi, I'm Miranda. Nice to meet you!

Hi, I'm Dana, nice to meet you, too!

We're doing a street interview.
Can I ask you some questions?

Oh, sure!

What is the most special gift you've ever received?

Good question... um, it was a silver necklace from my husband,
It was my birthday. He got me exactly the necklace I wanted.

What a sweet husband!
I'm here with Mike.

It was a kitty from my mom.
When she gave it to me,I was so surprised.
I'd always wanted a cat but she doesn't like cats.

And now I'm here with Lisa.

Um, the most special gift, for me,
is not a thing but a whole day from my boyfriend.

A great gift is not about money.
It's about caring for somebody.
And that brings us to the end of today's show. Goodbye for now.



大家好，我是Miranda。
欢迎收看流利说直播英语节目。
今天我们正在街头采访人们：
“你收到过的最特别的礼物是什么？”

你好，我叫Dana，很高兴认识你！
我们正在做一个街头采访。
我可以问你几个问题吗？
当然可以！
你收到过的最特别的礼物是什么？
好问题……嗯，是我丈夫送我的银项链，
那是我生日的时候他送给我的，
正好是我想要的那条项链。
你的丈夫真贴心！

和我在这里的是Mike。
是一只小猫，来自我妈妈。
当我妈妈把它送给我时，我非常惊喜。
我一直想要一只猫，可是她自己并不喜欢猫。

现在我在这里的是和Lisa。
对我来说，最特别的礼物不是一件物品，
而是我男朋友陪我度过的一整天。

一份好的礼物并不在于金钱的价值，
而是在于对一个人的关心。
今天的节目就到这里结束了，再见！

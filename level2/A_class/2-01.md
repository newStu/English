## 词汇课：餐饮用具

The man **brings** food to her house.

Wine usually comes in a **bottle** .

Coffee sometimes comes in a **can**.

The party was fan. We ate,danced and drank **alcohol**.

**Mugs** are usually for hot drinks.

It is called **"fast food"** because the food is made fast.

杯子通常是装热饮料。  
它被称为“快餐”，因为食物制作得很快。  
她用叉子吃沙拉。

:::danger 注意
"usually" 是一个频度副词，用于描述动作或状态发生的频率。它可以放在系动词、助动词之后或者实义动词之前。在您提到的两个例句中，"usually" 的位置体现了这一点：
Wine usually comes in bottles.

在这个句子中，"usually" 放在了行为动词 "come" 之前，这是因为它直接修饰动词 "come"，表示“通常装在瓶子里”。

Mugs are usually for hot drinks.

这里，"usually" 放在了系动词 "are" 之后，紧跟着介词短语 "for hot drinks"，这种用法同样正确，表明“杯子通常是为了热饮”。虽然紧跟在 "are" 之后，但实际上它修饰的是整个系表结构 "are for hot drinks"，强调这种状态或用途通常是这样的。
总之，频度副词如 "usually" 可以根据句子结构灵活放置，既可以放在实义动词之前，也可以放在系动词或助动词之后，其目的是清晰地传达动作或状态的频率。

## 听力课: 快餐车来啦

```txt
Food trucks have become very popular in the United States.
In fact, many cities now have food truck parks.
These food truck parks have tables and chairs, live music, restrooms,
and different food trucks every week.

Food trucks are like restaurants on wheels.
Hungry customers can walk right up to the trucks and order from the menu.
The food is then cooked to order.  （walk right up:直奔）

The most popular ones offer their customers interesting yet familiar foods.
One famous food truck, for example, sells donuts filled with chicken,
bacon,cream cheese, and chocolate.
This food truck calls its donuts "whole meals".

Another food truck sells waffles with fried crab and syrup.
While this may sound different, this menu item is really popular
and the waffles are always sold out!
There are many options to choose from because there are about 4,000 food trucks
in the USA and the food truck business continues to grow by about 8% every year.
Which one do you want to try?

餐车在美国已变得非常流行。事实上，许多城市现在都有餐车公园。
这些餐车公园配有桌椅、现场音乐、洗手间，每周还有不同的餐车入驻。
餐车就像是车轮上的餐厅。饥肠辘辘的顾客可以直接走到餐车前点餐，食物都是现点现做。
最受欢迎的餐车提供既新奇又熟悉的食物。
例如一家著名餐车售卖夹着鸡肉、培根、奶油奶酪和巧克力的甜甜圈，并称其为"甜甜圈全餐"。
另一家餐车售卖配炸蟹肉和糖浆的华夫饼。虽然听起来很特别，但这个菜品非常受欢迎，常常售罄。
美国约有4000辆餐车，且该行业每年以8%的速度增长，因此有众多选择。
你想尝试哪一家呢？

I'm coming I'm coming, just hold on a second. I'm trying to find my shoes.

The white ones or the black ones?

The black ones.

I don't know where they are.
Hey, while you're looking for your shoes, I want to bring something up.

What is it?

Remember when I promised to help you get a date?

Yes...

Well you have one on Thursday with one of Jane's friends. Her name's Rebecca.

What? You didn't even ask me!

Relax, Greg. She's an incredible girl.
She and you both love to go to music concerts, and you're both really smart.
I think it'll be a perfect date.

Perfect? Other than the fact that I didn't say yes.

There's no reason for you to not say yes.
You don't have to marry her, Greg.
Just go out with her for one night. It'll be good for you.

Fine...

Great! Did you find your shoes yet?

Yeah, they were under the couch.

Then let's go!


A : 格雷格，快走吧！我想在餐车收摊前找到它们。
B : 来了来了，稍等片刻。我正在找我的鞋子。
A : 白色的还是黑色的那双？
B : 黑色的。但我不知道放哪儿了。对了，趁你找鞋的时候，我有件事想跟你说。
A : 什么事？
B : 还记得我答应过帮你安排约会吗？
A : 记得...
B : 周四给你约了简的一个朋友，叫丽贝卡。
A : 啥？你都没问过我！
B : 放松点格雷格！她是个超棒的姑娘，和你一样爱看演唱会，还都很聪明。我觉得这约会完美。
A : 完美？除了我没有答应之外。

Well... I'm working on a story about food truck business.

So our lunch is part of your work too?

## 听力课: 轻轨

```txt
Have you ever traveled in a light rail before?
A "light rail" is like a train, but less heavy.
Light rails are great for these reasons:
they are friendly to the environment,comfortable,easy to travel on,and save time.

Light rails are friendly to the environment because they run on electricity.
They don't fill the environment with gases like cars do.
Since they are not very noisy, light rails are very comfortable to ride on.
The light rails in Hong Kong,
for example, are super clean and even have free WiFi.

Light rails can hold many people.
This means you don't have to wait very long for a light rail.
And there are fewer passengers.
Buses and cars spend a lot of time in traffic,
but light rails don't get into traffic jams.
This saves passengers' time.

你以前坐过轻轨吗？"轻轨"像火车，但更轻便。
轻轨很棒的原因有：它们环保、舒适、出行方便，还能节省时间。
轻轨环保是因为它们靠电力运行。不像汽车那样排放废气污染环境。
由于噪音不大，乘坐轻轨非常舒适。比如香港的轻轨，就超级干净，甚至还有免费WiFi。
轻轨可以承载很多人。这意味着你不用等很久就能坐上轻轨。而且乘客较少。
公交车和汽车经常堵车，但轻轨不会遇到交通堵塞。这为乘客节省了时间。

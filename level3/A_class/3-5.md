## 综合科: 初次约会

```txt
Are you Dan?

Yes, are you Hannah?

Yes, I'm Hannah. It's nice to meet you.

It's nice to meet you, too!
I've heard a lot of great things about you from Tom.

I've heard a lot about you, too, and I've been looking forward to our dinner.

Me, too! I hope this restaurant is okay.
None of the other places near here had any reservations for tonight.

It's great. Thanks for making the plans.

To be honest, I'm feeling pretty nervous!

Don't worry. First dates make me nervous, too.
Anyway enough of that subject! (不说这这个话题了)
It was great talking to you on the phone last night.

Same here! I've never met anyone who likes jazz music as much as I do.

Well... I've been playing the violin since I was ten.

You know, I started playing the saxophone when I was ten, too.

Nice! Only half of my musician friends started playing music at a young age.

So how did you get interested in jazz music?

My grandfather was a professional violinist in a Big Band orchestra.
And he gave me all of these jazz records.  How about you?

I joined the jazz band in high school.
I found that I really liked performing and playing jazz.

Do you still perform live?

I do. Actually, we have a show next Saturday.
Would you like to come? I can get you a ticket.

Sure. I'd love to see you play.

Hannah：你是Dan吗？
Dan： 是的，你是 Hannah吗？
Hannah：是的，我是 Hannah。很高兴认识你。
Dan： 我也很高兴认识你！我听汤姆说了很多关于你的好话。
Hannah：我也听说过很多关于你的事，一直很期待我们的晚餐。
Dan： 我也是！希望这家餐厅还行。附近其他店今晚都没订到位子。
Hannah：挺好的。谢谢你安排计划。说实话，我挺紧张的！
Dan： 别担心。第一次约会我也紧张。不说这个了！昨晚和你打电话很开心。
Hannah：我也是！从没遇到过像我这么喜欢爵士乐的人。
Dan： 嗯...我从十岁就开始拉小提琴了。
Hannah：巧了，我也是十岁开始吹萨克斯的。
Dan： 不错！我搞音乐的朋友里只有一半是小时候开始学的。
Hannah：那你怎么对爵士乐感兴趣的？
Dan： 我祖父是Big Band乐团的职业小提琴手，他给了我很多爵士唱片。你呢？
Hannah：高中时加入了爵士乐队，发现自己真的很喜欢演奏爵士乐。
Dan： 你现在还现场演出吗？
Hannah：演啊。其实下周六我们有场演出，要来看吗？我能给你弄张票。
Dan： 好啊，很想看你表演。
